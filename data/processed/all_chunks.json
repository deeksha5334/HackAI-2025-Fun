Baile, MD*\nDepartments of *Behavioral Science and/C160Investigational Cancer Therapeutics, The University of\nTexas, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, Texas\nnAbstract: Women with breast cancer have become increasingly more involved on a national and local level in advo-\ncating for resources to \ufb01ght cancer. However, in the context of the relationship with their physicians and other cancer care-givers, much remains to be done in providing them with adequate support. In this paper, we highlight the dif\ufb01culties in\ncommunication related to breast cancer and describe strategies and approaches that may be helpful in improving the\ncommunication throughout the cancer trajectory. Speci\ufb01cally, breast cancer patients have high unmet information needsrelevant to health information and dissatisfaction with the actual information they receive from their providers. These needsseem even more pronounced when patients are older, of lower socio-economic class and from differing cultural back-\ngrounds which may affect their ability to express their desires for information and desire to be involved in decision-making\nabout their treatment. Other communication challenges can be envisioned as occurring at key points across the cancertrajectory: diagnosis disclosure, treatment failure, transition to palliative care, and end of life discussions. These involvetechniques as basic as how to establish trust and rapport and determine a patient\u2019s information and decision-making prefer-\nences and as complex as giving bad news. These strategies are now viewed as essential skills in that they can affect\npatient distress and quality of life, satisfaction, and malpractice litigation as well as practitioner stress and burnout.\nn\nKey Words: breast cancer, physician\u2013patient relationship, provider\u2013patient communication\nCommunication is a multidimensional concept,\ninvolving both the content of discussion and the\nrelationship aspects of the interaction and includes\nverbal and nonverbal behaviors (1). From the clini-\ncian\u2019s standpoint, it encompasses several importantelements that impact directly upon patient care: (a)\ngathering information from the patient (eliciting the\nrelevant history, symptoms, patient perceptions, and\nconcerns); (b) providing information to the patient\n(ensuring patient comprehension, informed consent,\nparticipation in choice of treatment options, and\naccrual to clinical trials); (c) relationship-building\n(ensuring trust, con\ufb01dence, and in part, satisfaction\nwith care); and (d) supportive communication(addressing patient emotions and encouraging the\npatient) (2,3).\nCommunication is the cornerstone of comprehen-\nsive cancer care (4). Recently, information hasemerged to prompt a discussion of speci\ufb01c aspects of\ncommunication of importance to breast cancer clini-\ncians. In the \ufb01rst part of the paper, we highlight these\nand in the second part, we offer some practical tech-\nniques and approaches that may be improve commu-nication, based on studies and data that have been\nshown to have value in practice.\nPART I: SPECIFIC ISSUES IN THE BREAST\nCANCER CONTEXT\nInformation Needs and Challenges\nA study by Lobb et al. (5) underscored the impor-\ntance to breast cancer patients about information\nrelated to their disease. They found that 83% of\nwomen wanted as much information about their\ndisease as possible, whereas 16% wanted limited\ninformation. Additionally, 91% wanted to know their\nprognosis before beginning adjuvant treatment and\n63% wanted their oncologist to ask them if they\nwould like to know their prognosis.

    "text": "their illness and 91% wished for more information\nabout their illness (6).\nDespite these \ufb01ndings, women with breast cancer\nwho want to receive detailed information have\nreported high levels of unmet needs for health infor-\nmation, dif\ufb01culties in accessing relevant information,\nand dissatisfaction with the information received from\ntheir healthcare providers (5,7\u20139). Reasons for these\ninformation gaps are not completely clear. However,\navailable data suggest that doctors are not very goodat estimating the amount and type of information\npatients want or how effective they have been in\nimparting such information (10,11).\nParadoxically, despite having high information\nneeds, unless directly invited, many patients do not\nask pertinent questions, express concerns or ask for\nadditional information. Indirect \u2018\u2018cues\u2019\u2019 such as such\nas seeming anxious or perplexed when given infor-\nmation are far more common than direct requests for\ninformation or support. While clinicians seem ready\nto respond to direct expressions of need, they \ufb01nd itdif\ufb01cult to detect and respond to indirect behaviors\nsuch as facial expressions or allusions (12). Patients\nmay also assume that their doctors will tell them\nwhatever is relevant and some feel guilty about tak-\ning too much of the busy doctor\u2019s time with ques-\ntions (13\u201315). Therefore, in the absence of explicit\ndiscussion, physicians may make incorrect assump-\ntions and unilateral decisions about patients\u2019 infor-\nmation needs and preferences, and over-estimate theextent to which they provide desired information\n(16).\nThe take home message from these studies is that a\n\u2018\u2018disconnect\u2019\u2019 regarding information needs of patients\nmay occur and that assessing how much information\nthe patient wants to know (\u2018\u2018ask before you tell\u2019\u2019)\nabout their illness initially and periodically during the\ncourse of treatment comprises an approach recom-\nmended by many authors. How speci\ufb01c factors,\nincluding age, ethnicity, race, culture, and socioeco-\nnomic status in\ufb02uence women\u2019s information needsand preferences, has been of interest to a number of\ninvestigators. For example, Gustafson et al. found that\nage most consistently affected the variance in informa-\ntion preferences of patients and that as their age\nincreases, women look at the receipt of information as\nbeing less important (17,18). In a study by Liang\net al. (19), patients 80 years and older reported receiv-\ning markedly less information than younger patients\nabout treatment options, were less likely to be given achoice of treatment, and were less likely to initiate\ncommunication (19).\nOther authors have described the variation that\nexists within different cultures and the challenge about\nhow to provide honest information while respecting\ncultural norms. For example, Korean and Mexican\nAmericans were found to be unlikely to support the\nautonomy of the patient in making a treatment deci-\nsion, which is seen as the responsibility and \ufb01lial duty\nof the patient\u2019s family (20). In some cultures, the neg-ative stigma associated with the word \u2018\u2018cancer\u2019\u2019 is so\nstrong that the use of the word can be perceived as\nrude, disrespectful, and even causal (20). Chinese\nAmerican families may prefer that the patient not be\ntold that they have a terminal illness or face an immi-\nnent death, or the family may prefer to tell the patient\nthemselves. Healthcare providers should also commu-\nnicate with the head of the Filipino American family\nwhile out of the patient\u2019s presence (21,22). Thus, it is\nessential to understand the cultural context when talk-\ning with patients about their cancer.\nTreatment Decision-Making\nDecisions about breast cancer treatments are\nstrongly in\ufb02uenced by the quality of patient\u2013physician\ncommunication particularly for older and disadvan-\ntaged patients (19). For example, being unmarried,\nhaving a lower socioeconomic status and older age\nhave been found to be associated with less discussion\nof treatment options and also in\ufb02uence the type oftreatment received (6,18,23,24). Thus, improving the\nquality of communication at the level of patient\u2013\nphysician interaction could be an important avenue to\nreducing age and ethnic group treatment disparities\namong patients with breast cancer.\nMultiple options from which to choose about\nbreast surgery presents can present a vexing dilemma\nfor patients and a communication challenge for\nphysicians. Given that research has demonstrated that\nmastectomy and BCT with radiation have similar\nlong-term survival rates for women with early-stagedisease (25\u201328), attention to a woman\u2019s individual\nneeds and preferences and quality of life (QOL) issues\nas they contribute to treatment decisions is essential.\nOther issues that are associated with communica-\ntion of patient choice include the advisability of adju-\nvant endocrine therapy and lack of communication\nabout lymphedema following sentinel lymph node\nbiopsy alone or with axillary dissection (29\u201331).\nWomen undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer70\u2022parker et al .\n 15244741, 2009, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4741.2008.00673.x by University Of Texas - Dallas, Wiley Online Library on [19/04/2025].

    "text": "often have the option of having reconstructive surgery.\nThere has been some speculation that talking to\nwomen about reconstruction before surgery can mini-\nmize the psychological distress of a mastectomy (32).\nSeveral investigators suggest that it may be therapeutic\nfor surgeons to discuss this possibility with women\nbecause it can help create a more hopeful outlook of\nliving with the dis\ufb01gurement of the surgery, as well as\nproviding women with a sense of the doctor\u2019s belief in\nthe probability of their survival. Several factors thathave been found to be associated with not having\nreconstruction include older age, lack of information,\nconcerns about costs, fear of additional surgery, fear\nof recurrence, uncertainty about outcome, negative\nattitudes within society toward reconstruction, and\npsychological obstacles (32). C onversely, reasons reported\nby women for having reconstruction include getting\nrid of an external breast prosthesis, being able to wear\na greater variety of clothes, and restoring feelings of\nwholeness and body integrity. Younger women are\nmore likely to choose reconstructive surgery. Manyolder women, however, view reconstruction as too\nmuch additional surgery and pain and expressed that\ntheir breasts were no longer that important to them.\nSome remarked that they would have pursued recon-\nstruction if they were younger. In spite of this,\ncomments from women not offered reconstruction\nreinforce the importance of informing patients of all\noptions: \u2018\u2018It would have been nice if it were offered\neven though I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it\u2019\u2019 (33).Discussing reconstruction with their surgeon likely\nwould eliminate many of these concerns, as 17% of\nwomen over 60 years in one study were not offered\nreconstruction (33). In summary, surgeons should\noffer reconstruction to women of all age though\npatients older than 60 years are less likely to proceed\nwith and complete reconstruction (33).\nKey Communication Challenges Along the Illness\nTrajectory\nDiagnosis Disclosure\nPatients differ in their ability to integrate threaten-\ning information and concordance between the disclo-\nsure of information and the patient\u2019s ability to deal\nwith that information is the gold standard for success-\nful communication (34,35). Maguire (14) found that\nwhen doctors conduct a patient-centered diagnostic\nconsultation and ask patients about their perceptions\nof their problems, their reactions to their problems,\nand how their illness impacts their daily lives, patientsfeel more satis\ufb01ed and are more compliant with the\nadvice and treatment regimens offered.\nBefore talking with patients, it is important for the\nclinician to realize that the structure and content of\nthe consultation in\ufb02uences the patient\u2019s ability to\nremember what has been said in several ways: (a)\npatients usually recall facts provided at the start of a\nconsultation more readily than those given later; (b)\ntopics deemed most relevant and important to the\npatient (which might not be those considered mostpertinent to the doctor) are recalled most accurately;\n(c) the greater the number of statements made by a\ndoctor, the smaller the mean percentage of informa-\ntion recalled by the patient; and (d) items that patients\ndo manage to recall do not decay over time as do\nother memories; in fact, many patients have verbatim\nrecall of what they believe the doctor said (13).\nWhen Treatment Fails\nPrognosis is an important topic when talking about\ndecision-making by patients and is of heightened con-cern when breast cancer has recurred. When a deci-\nsion is made on the basis of accurate prognostication,\nproblems frequently arise. For one, there are few\ntraining resources and little guidance available for\nclinicians in communicating prognosis (36). Addition-\nally, some patients with metastatic disease over-\nestimate prognosis and are more likely to favor\nlife-extending treatment, perhaps to the detriment of\nQOL (36). Some research suggests that at least part ofthe reasons for hopeful patient prognostication could\nbe due to the generally optimistic prognostic estimates\nthat physicians give their patients or omission of prog-\nnostic discussions altogether (37). Although most doc-\ntors in western countries give patients their diagnosis\nof cancer, information about prognosis is less com-\nmonly presented, even when patients indicate a prefer-\nence for receiving this information. Yet it has been\ndemonstrated that if actively encouraged to ask ques-\ntions, prognosis is the one area in which patients\nincrease question asking (36).\nData from Gustafson et al. (17) revealed that recur-\nrence was an issue of great importance to all those\nwho were involved in the breast cancer experience.\nRegardless of one\u2019s level of sophistication, when com-\nmunicating with patients facing metastatic disease and\ndeath, loved ones and caring professionals can help, at\na minimum by easing the sense of \u2018\u2018aloneness\u2019\u2019 the\ndying person may feel.

    "text": "abandon a patient. This commitment derives from the\nknowledge that, at times, simply being present can\nmake a critical therapeutic difference (38).\nTransition to Palliative Care\nCommunicating with patients who have advanced\ncancer is dif\ufb01cult for many physicians and has been\nwidely discussed in the medical literature. Physician\ndif\ufb01culties include countertransference issues sur-\nrounding their own fear of dying, psychological traitsin some physicians that may lead to a need to over-\ncome fears of death, and the historical tendency in\nwestern medicine to focus on cure (14,39\u201342). Addi-\ntionally, physicians are trained to maintain health and\n\ufb01ght illness, but typically receive little guidance on\nhow to communicate with dying patients and their\nfamilies. Thus, in our death-averse society, it is not\nsurprising that many physicians \ufb01nd it uncomfortable\nto engage in end-of-life discussions (14,42).\nAnother impediment to honest disclosure is that\ndeath has long been regarded as tantamount to medi-cal failure, particularly in western culture. The impli-\ncation to some physicians is that they have nothing to\noffer a dying patient and family, although the opposite\nis true. Good communication can, in fact, help allay\nfears, minimize pain and suffering, and enable patients\nand their families to experience a \u2018\u2018good death\u2019\u2019\n(14,42). On the other hand, poor communication may\nresult in suboptimal care, and patients and their fami-\nlies may be subjected to undue mental or physicalanguish (14,42). Physicians must strive to achieve a\ndelicate balance between providing honest information\nand doing so in a sensitive way that does not discour-\nage hope (39). Physicians who are too blunt can shat-\nter hope and leave patients feeling abandoned, a\nsituation that can be ameliorated by increased sensitiv-\nity to timing discussions, the milieu in which discus-\nsions occur, and enhanced communication skills (43).\nHowever, few physicians feel adequately trained to\nbreak bad news. In one study, 50% of oncologists\nrated their own ability to break bad news as poor tofair (39).\nBecause there is variability among patients about\nthe amount of information they want and how quickly\nthey want to receive it, sensitive physicians can gauge\nwhen a patient is ready to hear bad news. For clini-\ncians who fear that breaking bad news will destroy\npatients\u2019 hopes, there is convincing evidence that most\ncancer patients want the physician to provide them in\na caring way with thorough information about theirdiagnosis, prognosis, and treatment options, and that\nincomplete information could actually erode patient\nhopefulness (44,45) and trust. It is important however,\nthat the physician does not assume that all patients\nwant to be told about their prognosis. They should be\naware that patients often signal to the doctor when\nand how much information they want or are able to\ncope with (14,36).\nEnd-of-life Discussions\nBecause most patients want to discuss end-of-life\ncare with their physicians, and most believe that phy-\nsicians should introduce the topic, physicians should\ninitiate timely dialogue, as many patients will wait for\nthem to raise the subject (42). Additionally, studies\nhave shown that patients prefer to discuss advanced\ndirectives early in the patient\u2013physician relationship\nand that advance care planning can be effectively\nintroduced in an outpatient setting (46). Studies have\nalso found that even though patients with cancer want\ntheir physicians to provide detailed prognoses, theyalso want their physicians to give them good news\nand to be hopeful about their illnesses (37).\nPART 2: SPECIFIC TECHNIQUES THAT\nFACILITATE COMMUNICATION\nCommunication Skills: Can they be Taught and\nLearned?\nDuring a clinical career that spans approximately\n40 years, an oncologist is likely to conduct between\n150,000 and 200,000 consultations with patients and\ntheir families (47). Thus, communication should be\nviewed as a core clinical skill that merits a consider-\nable investment of time and resources in training (13).\nThis is particularly important in view of the fact that\nmany oncologists become disillusioned with their\nwork, experience stress, and show signs of burnout\n(13).\nEmpathy and compassion are increasingly consid-\nered important topics for medical student training,\nessential components of the physician\u2013patient relation-\nship, and the foundations of ethical medical practice.\nBreast cancer activists appeal for greater physician\ncompassion and awareness of the dif\ufb01culties patients\nhave in understanding medical information after the\ntrauma of a cancer diagnosis (48). Empathic relation-\nships with patients not only promote trust but also\nreduce patient anxiety (48), increase satisfaction with72\u2022parker et al .\n 15244741, 2009, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4741.2008.00673.x by University Of Texas - Dallas, Wiley Online Library on [19/04/2025].

    "text": "the medical encounter, are an important factor in\nmedical malpractice claims and promote a therapeutic\nrelationship with the patient. Findings in one study\ndesigned to monitor physician responses to nonverbal\ncues by patients underscore the importance of the doc-\ntor\u2019s role in directly encouraging the expression of\nemotional needs and suggest that communication\ntraining should include skills development in this\naspect of doctor\u2013patient communication (12). A recent\nstudy by Pollack et al. (49) examined empathic oppor-tunities and empathic responses in audio recordings\nbetween oncologists and patients with advanced can-\ncer. They found that there were few empathic oppor-\ntunities in the consultations and that oncologists\nrarely provided empathic responses. They suggest that\noncologists may bene\ufb01t from more training in how to\nencourage patients to express their emotions and how\nto respond to them empathically in order to reduce\npatient anxiety and increase satisfaction (49).\nResponding to basic de\ufb01ciencies in preparing oncol-\nogists and other healthcare providers for working withpatients, educators have looked at ways to train future\nand current physicians to communicate effectively\n(14,34,40,44). One training approach involves con-\nducting communication skills workshops to provide\ntraining to oncologists in stressful aspects of the physi-\ncian\u2013patient relationship (44). Back et al., for exam-\nple, conducted a workshop-based communication\nskills training program for oncology fellows (50). The\nworkshop increased the oncology fellows\u2019 skills inbreaking bad news and transitioning to palliative\ncare (50). Various investigators have looked at desir-\nable behaviors in healthcare professionals to guide the\ndevelopment of helpful interventions. For example,\nHarris and Templeton (51) identi\ufb01ed behaviors\ndesired in future physicians (medical students). These\nwere to listen to the patient, \ufb01nd out about the\npatient\u2019s knowledge level about their disease, honesty,\npartnering with the patient, comfort using touch while\ncommunicating with the patient, making eye contact,\nsaying something realistically hopeful, validating thepatient\u2019s concerns, answering the patient\u2019s questions,\ndisplaying interest in the patient as a person, having\nan attitude of curiosity about the patient\u2019s needs, isn\u2019t\nall-knowing, having respect for the patient\u2019s knowl-\nedge and experience, and supporting the patient\u2019s\ninformed decision (51).\nWhen treatment fails, it is important to break the\nbad news to patients in a helpful way. Various\nschemes have been espoused as helpful for breakingthe bad news to patients with cancer. One is the six-\nstep SPIKES protocol formulated by Baile et al. (52),\nwhich is an individualized, patient-centered approach\nfor breaking bad news. This technique has been rated\nhighly by oncology practitioners and incorporates the\nrecommendations of communication experts, patients,\nnurses, and oncologists for disclosing unfavorable\ninformation to cancer patients. This approach is tai-\nlored to the individual needs and coping style of the\npatient. In brief, the acronym is: S = get the settingright; P = understand the patient\u2019s perception of the\nillness; I = obtain an invitation to impart information;\nK = provide knowledge and education; E = respond to\nthe patient\u2019s emotions with empathy, i.e., responses,\ngestures; S = provide a summary strategy, i.e., respond\nto questions and discuss treatment options. Incorpo-\nrated into skill-based workshops this method has been\nshown to increase fellows\u2019 competency in several\ndimensions of giving bad news (50). Girgis and\nSanson-Fisher (53) presented similar guidelines for\nbreaking the bad news which included: ensuring pri-vacy and adequate time, assessing patients\u2019 under-\nstanding, providing information simply and honestly,\navoiding euphemisms, encouraging patients to express\ntheir feelings, being empathic, giving a broad but real-\nistic time frame about prognosis, and arranging a\nreview of the information given (53).\nPatient education is also an important aspect of\ntraining in communication skills and various interven-\ntions have been designed to meet this need (15,54). Inanother patient education intervention, an existential-\nphenomenological approach was used to evaluate the\nbene\ufb01ts of social support for women with breast can-\ncer in a computer-mediated context, speci\ufb01cally using\nthe Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support Sys-\ntem (CHESS) computer network (55\u201359). Patients\nbene\ufb01ted from the information given, social support\nreceived, and increased participation in their illness\nthat came from the use of CHESS (55\u201359).\nConclusion and Future Directions\nMuch research in this area has already been accom-\nplished and some important \ufb01ndings, such as promot-\ning treatment choice for women, have already been\ntranslated into clinical practice. However, much more\nresearch needs to be done, especially at the level of\nthe optimal time during treatment to introduce vari-\nous issues and in \ufb01nding practical ways for assessing\nwomen\u2019s information needs, incorporating supportive\ntechniques into everyday clinical practice, andCommunication and Breast Cancer \u202273\n 15244741, 2009, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4741.2008.00673.x by University Of Texas - Dallas, Wiley Online Library on [19/04/2025].

With this in\nmind, constructive patient\u2013physician relationships areessential to minimizing disease-related stress and anxiety,\nas patients undergo treatment and learn to cope with their\ndiagnosis. Good communication skills are vital, and achievemeasurable bene\ufb01ts, yet doctors receive very little training\nin communication. Patients may \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to process\nlarge amounts of information, may not understand medicalterminology, and can become confused or scared during\ndiscussions. They may need time to absorb information, and\ndiscuss it with friends and family, before treatment deci-sions are made. Patient awareness of treatment options is\ngreater than ever, largely because of media exposure and the\ninternet. Consequently, patients\u2019 expectations and desire tobe involved in treatment choice are increasing, although\nsome patients still prefer to leave decision-making to their\ndoctor. Information about potential side-effects and othertreatment burdens is vital, if patients are to make truly\ninformed choices. Knowing in advance what side effects\nmay be encountered, and how to manage them, can also\nhelp to improve adherence to treatment, which is necessary\nfor patients to gain the maximum bene\ufb01t. Side effects thatpatients \ufb01nd most problematic often differ from those that\nmost concern doctors. Individual patients have different\nneeds and expectations that must be respected, but ensuringthat they understand their diagnosis, and the expected\nbene\ufb01ts and potential risks of treatment, is the key to\nestablishing a good therapeutic relationship and providingthe best possible care.Keywords Decision making /C1Breast cancer /C1\nDoctor\u2013Patient relationship\nIntroduction\nEffective communication between doctor and patient is\nessential to best practice in the management of breast\ncancer [ 1]. Good communication results in measurable\nbene\ufb01ts, including shorter hospital stays, fewer complica-tions, better adherence to treatment, increased patient\nsatisfaction and understanding, and decreased anxiety,\nuncertainty and likelihood of litigation.\nDespite these bene\ufb01ts, doctors still receive inadequate\ntraining in communication skills. It is often assumed that\nsuch skills will be learned through practice, but in reality,senior doctors report the same communication dif\ufb01culties\nas their more junior colleagues [ 2]. Burnout, a combination\nof emotional exhaustion, perceived lack of accomplish-ment, and low job satisfaction, is highest among doctors\nwho feel they have not received adequate training in\ncommunication and management skills [ 3]. As hospital\ndoctors may perform up to 200,000 patient interviews\nduring their career [ 4], communication is clearly an area\nrequiring urgent attention.\nFollowing a diagnosis of breast cancer, good commu-\nnication is essential, to ensure that patients do not leave the\nconsultation confused about what their diagnosis meansand what their options are. Many patients want more\ninformation about their disease and potential treatments,\nand physicians should ensure that adequate time is allo-cated to discussing treatment options and available sources\nof additional information. Delivering this in an appropri-\nately paced manner is an advanced but worthwhile skillthat helps avoid information overload, particularly in\nL. J.

    "text": "distressed patients who have just received their diagnosis.\nResearch shows that patients who know more about their\ntreatment and care options worry less, and have better\noutcomes, than those who are less well informed [ 5].\nMany treatment options are available for both early and\nadvanced breast cancer, consideration of which can be\nquite daunting for patients. Inviting women to take part inthe decision-making process, but not imposing it on them,\ncan increase both acceptance of therapy and consequent\nadherence. All treatments (surgery, radiotherapy, chemo-\ntherapy and endocrine therapy) have side effects, and\nindividual patients may have strong aversions to some ofthem, which will in\ufb02uence treatment choices [ 6]. Doctors\nshould be aware that the side effects that concern patients\nthe most (e.g. alopecia, loss of libido, fatigue, and hot\ufb02ashes) are not necessarily the same ones that doctors\nconsider most problematic. Although not life-threatening,\nthese symptoms can have a detrimental impact on patients\u2019quality of life (QoL), which can ultimately affect their\nwillingness to continue with treatment. Symptoms that\nhave the greatest impact on QoL are often underestimatedor unrecognized by clinicians [ 7,8]. Although many large\nclinical trial protocols now include a QoL substudy, where\nstandardized questionnaires probe aspects of disease andtreatment that affect QoL, these areas are rarely discussed\nin routine clinical assessments, hence the discrepancies.\nThe use of newer, more effective anticancer agents can\nsigni\ufb01cantly reduce disease recurrence. Their follow-up\nperiod is still rather short, however, thus their long-term\nsafety and true impact on QoL may not become evident formany years. For example, the side effects of tamoxifen\nwere not apparent until it had been in use for some time.\nThis creates a problem, as patients need to be clear aboutpotential bene\ufb01ts and risks before deciding on and starting\nany medical intervention. In this article, the impact of\nanticancer therapy on the patient is discussed, with a par-ticular focus on the importance of effective doctor\u2013patient\ncommunication, and the involvement of patients in the\ntreatment decision-making process.\nCommunicating diagnosis and prognosis\nEach year, approximately 1.2 million women are diag-\nnosed with breast cancer worldwide [ 9], making it the most\ncommon cancer in women. A woman\u2019s lifetime risk of\ndeveloping breast cancer has been estimated at 1 in 8 [ 10].\nBreast cancer has been reported to be the disease that manywomen fear the most [ 11], although they are actually nine\ntimes more likely to die of heart disease [ 12]. As the\ndiagnosis of breast cancer can be devastating, doctorsshould be aware that patients may not be able to understand\nthe implications fully, or absorb large amounts ofinformation immediately after hearing the diagnosis. Thus,\nfollowing an initial discussion about further tests and\ntreatment options, patients need time to consider these, and\ntalk about them with friends and relatives, before returningwith their questions at the next consultation. However,\ndoctors should also be aware that many patients are\nreluctant to ask questions about their illness [ 13], and may\nneed encouragement to talk about their disease and the\npossible treatments. Providing information on patient\nsupport groups and outside sources of information can also\nbe very helpful to patients. In the UK, the vast majority of\npatients with cancer want to be told what their diagnosis is,and what the treatment options are, and to be given both\ngood and bad news [ 14,15]. The pacing of information-\ngiving is an important skill for doctors.\nFollowing a diagnosis of breast cancer, patients may\nexperience many feelings, including anger, grief, distress\nand guilt. These emotions can be overwhelming, adverselyaffecting patients\u2019 QoL. However, responses to the diag-\nnosis differ greatly: some patients may view it as a\nchallenge and invest their energy in \ufb01ghting the disease,whereas others may feel helpless and hopeless, or develop\ndepression or anxiety disorders. Psychological assess-\nments\u2013\u2013and, where necessary, appropriate therapy\u2013\u2013canhelp patients come to terms with their situation, and\nimprove treatment acceptance and disease outcomes [ 16].\nTreatment decision-making in early breast cancer\nOver the last 20 years or so, several studies have investi-\ngated the role of the patient in the selection of breast cancer\ntherapy, and found that most patients prefer to have somedegree of involvement during the decision-making process.\nThree main styles of patient decision-making have been\nidenti\ufb01ed. Passive involvement , as the name suggests,\nmeans that the patient prefers to leave the treatment deci-\nsion to others, usually their doctor. Shared decision-making\ninvolves collaboration between patient and physician,while active decision-making indicates that the patient\nprefers to make the choice of therapy alone [ 17]. The\npreferred role of patients in treatment selection varies\nbetween studies, and is often in\ufb02uenced by patient char-\nacteristics, such as age and education. Older and less\neducated patients, for example, are more likely to prefer apassive or collaborative role [ 18,19], whereas an active\nrole is generally preferred by younger and better educated\npatients [ 20].\nInvolving patients in treatment decision-making can be\nempowering at any stage of the disease. Active participa-\ntion can help patients to feel that they have some controlover their future, and may reduce the psychological mor-\nbidity associated with cancer. However, while several6 Breast Cancer Res Treat (2008) 112:5\u201313\n123",

    "text": "recent studies have reported a trend towards an increase in\nthe number of women who prefer to take an active role in\ntreatment decision-making [ 21\u201324], it is important to rec-\nognize that some patients \ufb01nd being involved in the processtoo great a responsibility, and prefer their doctor to make\nthe decision. In a recent study of decision-making prefer-\nences in patients with gynecologic cancers, a substantialproportion preferred to either share the decision or delegate\nthe choice to their doctor [ 25].\nWhatever a patient\u2019s preferred role in treatment decision-\nmaking, a match between the preferred level of participa-\ntion and the actual level of involvement is a strong predictorof satisfaction with treatment outcomes [ 21,22]. Further-\nmore, the key to achieving the right degree of involvement\nfor the individual patient is adequate access to informationabout the disease, the available treatment options and the\nassociated risks and bene\ufb01ts [ 26]. Women with access to\nsuch information are more likely to be satis\ufb01ed with theirdecision-making than those without [ 23,27].\nTherapy for breast cancer can include several approa-\nches, with different considerations at each stage and foreach type of treatment. The important issues, and potential\nbene\ufb01ts of involving patients, at each stage are discussed\nbelow.\nBreast surgery and radiotherapy\nFor women with operable breast cancer, mastectomy,\nbreast-conserving surgery (BCS), wide local excision\n(WLE) or lumpectomy may be available. Following\nlumpectomy, radiotherapy to the surrounding breast tissuemay also be considered, to reduce locoregional recurrence.\nNeoadjuvant (or primary systemic) therapy may also be\noffered, to shrink or down-stage a tumor to reduce theextent of surgery required, to improve the cosmetic out-\ncome or, for women with inoperable tumors, to render the\ntumor operable.\nWomen facing surgery for early breast cancer are\nincreasingly taking a more active approach to treatment\ndecision-making [ 21,22,24]. Evidence suggests that\nwomen who prefer to take an active role in the choice of\nsurgery are more likely to achieve their desired level of\nparticipation in the decision-making process [ 24]. More-\nover, patients who achieve their desired role in decision-\nmaking are more likely to be satis\ufb01ed with their surgery\nchoice, although reported concordance rates between desiredand actual roles range between 49% and 61% [ 24,28].\nConcordance between patient perspectives and physician\nviews on treatment decision-making is also limited; in a2004 study by Janz and colleagues, only 38% of patients\nagreed with their doctor\u2019s assessment of how the treatment\ndecision was made [ 21], indicating a need for better\npatient\u2013physician communication.The psychological effects of being offered a choice of\nmastectomy or lumpectomy have been investigated, but\nmany studies had short follow-up periods and small sample\nsizes. More recent studies are retrospective, with no con-temporaneous evidence to support what actually happened\nduring an interview. It might be predicted that, given a\nchoice, most women would prefer BCS and would bene\ufb01tpsychologically from being offered the choice, but in fact,\nthere is little evidence for either claim [ 29]. Several studies\nhave shown that providing patients with greater autonomy\nin surgical treatment selection does not necessarily result in\na reduced rate of mastectomy [ 22,24,28].\nIn a 3-year prospective study of 269 women aged\n\\75 years with stage I or II breast cancer, semi-structured\npsychiatric interviews and standardized questionnaireassessments were performed before surgery and at 2 weeks\nand 3, 12, 24 and 36 months thereafter [ 30]. Psychological\noutcomes were assessed in women treated by surgeons whofavored mastectomy ( n=30), those who favored lump-\nectomy where possible (\nn= 121), and those who offered a\nchoice of treatment where possible ( n=118).\nAt 3 years, data were available for 216 (80%) women.\nAnxiety and depression that warranted intervention were\nfound in a signi\ufb01cant minority of patients. The risks ofanxiety and depression were signi\ufb01cantly reduced in\nwomen who were given a choice, compared with women\nwho were treated by surgeons favoring mastectomy(P\\0.05). However, psychological morbidity was not\naffected by being offered a choice regarding surgery. Of\nthe 118 women treated by the \u2018choice\u2019 surgeons, 56 werenot actually given a choice, because of technical consid-\nerations such as a large central lump in a small breast.\nAnxiety and depression were not different in these 56women compared to the 62 who were offered a choice:\nmerely being treated by a \u2018choice\u2019 surgeon had psycho-\nlogical bene\ufb01ts.\nThe probable explanations for this seemingly strange\n\ufb01nding all related to communication. More of the women\ntreated by \u2018choice\u2019 surgeons were satis\ufb01ed with the infor-mation and communication when the diagnosis was\ndiscussed, than in the other two groups ( P\\0.01). In the\nsample as a whole, women who perceived their informationas good were less likely to be anxious and/or depressed\nthan those who perceived it as bad at 12, 24 and 36 months\npost-diagnosis ( P=0.005). These \ufb01ndings suggest that,\nalthough there may be little direct psychological bene\ufb01t in\ninvolving patients in treatment decision-making, providing\nclear and accurate information is important for the patient\u2019slong-term acceptance of breast cancer treatment.\nThe psychosocial impact of mastectomy or lumpectomy\nmay be in\ufb02uenced by the cosmetic outcome of surgery,and breast reconstruction can be offered to help patients\novercome the trauma of surgery.

    "text": "investigated whether lumpectomy has psychological ben-\ne\ufb01ts over mastectomy, and how breast reconstruction\nreduces the negative impact of surgery on patients\u2019 mental\nhealth.\nA retrospective analysis of 577 patients with primary\nbreast cancer revealed a signi\ufb01cant bene\ufb01t in favor of\nlumpectomy plus reconstruction compared with mastec-tomy or lumpectomy alone, when assessed using self-\nevaluation questionnaires. Mastectomy was associated with\nthe greatest psychosocial morbidity (anxiety, depression,\nbody image and sexuality) [ 31].\nIn a separate study, good cosmetic outcome after\nlumpectomy correlated with levels of anxiety and depres-\nsion, body image, sexuality and self-esteem [ 32],\nsuggesting that the cosmetic result has a marked impact onfuture psychosocial wellbeing. The timing of reconstruc-\ntive surgery also affects psychological morbidity: prompt\nreconstruction is associated with less anxiety and depres-sion, and improved self-esteem and perceptions of personal\nattractiveness, compared with delayed reconstruction [ 33].\nThese \ufb01ndings support the use of neoadjuvant therapy toincrease eligibility for lumpectomy, and reduce the number\nof women undergoing mastectomy. Expeditious breast\nreconstruction could reduce the psychological burden ofbreast cancer and surgical intervention.\nSystemic adjuvant therapy\nSystemic adjuvant therapy reduces the risk of the patient\ndeveloping metastatic breast cancer, by targeting unde-\ntectable micrometastases at distant sites. Patients mayreceive adjuvant endocrine therapy (for hormone-receptor-\npositive [HR +] disease), chemotherapy, or both, with the\nchoice of treatment depending largely on the estimated riskof relapse. Patient acceptance of the need for adjuvant\ntherapy (and therefore their willingness to start treatment)\ndepends on the information they are given about treatmentoptions; the potential bene\ufb01ts, possible side effects and\nconvenience of treatment; patients\u2019 prior knowledge and\nexpectations of treatment; and the advice they receive fromothers. While patients are receiving treatment, adherence to\ntherapy is in\ufb02uenced by the actual burden experienced,\nand its impact on the patient\u2019s daily functioning and QoL[34,35].\nEffective communication of the risk of recurrence, and\nthe potential bene\ufb01ts of adjuvant therapy in reducing thatrisk, is essential for patients to understand what the\nfuture may hold for them, and how adjuvant therapy can\nimprove outcomes. Only then can patients makeinformed choices about their treatment. All information\ngiven and recommendations made to patients should be\nbased on accurate and credible evidence from robustclinical trials.Communicating risk in lay terms can be dif\ufb01cult. Ulti-\nmately, it is the healthcare professional\u2019s responsibility to\nensure that patients are given information in an under-\nstandable format. Physicians and other healthcareprofessionals should remember that most patients are not\nfamiliar with terms such as \u2018relative risk reduction\u2019; they\nmay not understand their meaning, or the implications ofdata presented in these formats. It is essential, therefore, to\ncommunicate with patients using language that is familiar\nto them, and that they understand.\nThe adverse effects of a treatment have a signi\ufb01cant\nimpact on its acceptability to patients. In general, the acutetoxicities of chemotherapy (e.g. nausea and vomiting,\nstomatitis, alopecia) are generally far less tolerable than the\nside effects of endocrine therapy, which are generallysimilar to the symptoms of menopause. Chemotherapy may\nnot, therefore, be considered acceptable therapy for\npatients with small, low-grade, strongly HR +tumors, who\nwould probably bene\ufb01t more from endocrine therapy [ 35],\nor for elderly or frail patients with other comorbidities.\nPatients\u2019 wishes must also be taken into consideration:chemotherapy-associated alopecia can be very distressing,\nparticularly for women who are struggling with body\nimage issues after breast surgery.\nTamoxifen has been the standard adjuvant endocrine\ntherapy for HR +breast cancer for several decades. The\ncurrent recommended duration of tamoxifen treatment islimited to 5 years, although recent data suggest that\n10 years of treatment reduces disease recurrence [ 36].\nHowever, longer-term use of tamoxifen is also associatedwith an unfavorable risk-bene\ufb01t ratio, due to a persistent\nexcess of potentially life-threatening adverse events\n(thromboembolic disease, stroke and endometrial cancer).Even among patients who do not experience these serious\nadverse events, less severe toxicities, especially hot \ufb02ashes,\ncan have a detrimental effect on QoL and reduce adherence[37,38].\nThe route of administration of adjuvant therapy may\nalso affect patient acceptability and adherence. Manypatients develop a phobia of needles during or after intra-\nvenous (IV) chemotherapy, and will refuse further therapy\nvia this route [ 39]; however, it may be possible to alleviate\nor prevent such problems if psychosocial support is pro-\nvided. On the other hand, providing IV therapy in the\nhospital does remove the problems of adherence associatedwith oral medications taken in the home. Non-adherence is\ncommon with oral adjuvant therapy [ 40\n], and is likely to\nreduce the expected ef\ufb01cacy of treatment. Patients must beeducated about the importance of adhering to their treat-\nment regimen, and urged to contact their doctor if adverse\neffects occur and result in non-adherence. It is alsoimportant that patients understand that options are avail-\nable to manage side effects, should they occur.8 Breast Cancer Res Treat (2008) 112:5\u201313\n123",

    "text": "Impact of adjuvant treatment on quality of life\nPatients are clinically cancer-free when adjuvant therapy is\nstarted and, therefore, they will not gain perceptible ben-\ne\ufb01ts from treatment. On the other hand, adverse effectsmay negatively affect patients\u2019 daily functioning. Side\neffects that have the greatest impact on patients\u2019 QoL are\nnot usually life-threatening, and therefore often differ fromthose that most concern physicians. Consequently, such\nside effects may be dismissed or not even considered when\ndiscussing treatment (planned and ongoing) with patients[41].\nIn recent years, the third-generation aromatase inhibitors\n(AIs; letrozole, anastrozole and exemestane) have becomeavailable, and have challenged the supremacy of tamoxifen\nin the adjuvant setting. A number of large, randomized\ncontrolled trials have assessed the overall value of AIs;these trials have had three main designs:\n\u20225 years\u2019 tamoxifen therapy versus 5 years\u2019 treatment\nwith an AI.\n\u20225 years\u2019 tamoxifen versus a protocol consisting of\ntamoxifen for 2\u20133 years, followed by a switch to an AIfor the remainder of the 5-year period.\n\u2022Placebo versus AI in patients who have already\ncompleted 5 years\u2019 treatment with tamoxifen (\u2018extendedadjuvant\u2019 therapy).\nThe impact of AI therapy on QoL has been investigated\nin three of these trials: ATAC, IES and MA.17 (Table 1)\n[42\u201344]. The \ufb01ndings of the MA.17 trial are discussed\nseparately, as it deals with extended adjuvant therapy.\nIn the ATAC (Arimidex, Tamoxifen, Alone or in Com-\nbination) Adjuvant Breast Cancer Trial [ 45,46], 5 years\u2019treatment with anastrozole monotherapy was associated\nwith a lower risk of disease recurrence ( P=0.015) and\ncontralateral breast cancer than with tamoxifen mono-\ntherapy. Combination therapy with anastrozole andtamoxifen did not confer any bene\ufb01t over tamoxifen alone;\nthis regimen is thus not recommended for use in clinical\npractice, and will not be discussed further here.\nAs part of the ATAC trial, 1021 patients took part in a\nsubstudy to assess the impact of long-term adjuvant ther-\napy on QoL, 682 of whom received either anastrozole or\ntamoxifen alone (Table 1)[42]. QoL was assessed at\nbaseline and again at predetermined intervals for 5 years,using the FACT-B (Functional Assessment of Cancer\nTherapy-Breast) questionnaire (version 3) in conjunction\nwith an 18-item endocrine subscale (ES). The primaryoutcome was the Trial Outcome Index (TOI), which\ncombines scores from two of the domains from the FACT-\nB (physical and functional) with the score from the ES foreach patient; the maximum score for the 23 items in this\nindex is 92. Higher TOI (and FACT-B) scores correlate\nwith better QoL; a change in TOI of \u00b15 points is con-\nsidered clinically signi\ufb01cant.\nAt 2 years\u2019 follow-up, both anastrozole and tamoxifen\nwere associated with increases in TOI (i.e. improvementsin QoL) from baseline to 2 years (means +4.16 vs. +3.49,\nrespectively; not statistically signi\ufb01cant). Additionally,\nmost patients in both treatment arms had clinically sig-ni\ufb01cant improvements in QoL during the same period (i.e.\nan increase in TOI of C5 points): 60.0% for anastrozole,\nand 61.9% for tamoxifen [ 47].\nThe \ufb01nal 5-year data from the monotherapy arms of the\nATAC health-related QoL substudy con\ufb01rmed the initial\n\ufb01ndings. There was no statistically signi\ufb01cant difference in\nTable 1 Quality-of-life (QoL) subanalyses of large randomized, multicenter trials of aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant [ 42,43] or extended\nadjuvant [ 44] therapy in early breast cancer\nStudy Design QoL substudy\nn Duration (years) Instrument(s) Primary endpoint\nATAC [ 42] Adjuvant therapy 5 years ANA vs 335 5 FACT-B +ES TOI\n5 years TAMa347\nIES [ 43] Adjuvant therapy 5 years TAM ?EXE vs 289 2 FACT-B +ES TOI\n5 years TAM ?TAMb293\nMA.17 [ 44] Extended adjuvant therapy 5 years LET vs 1813 3 SF-36 Not stated\n5 years PLAc1799 MENQOL\naIn patients who had completed primary therapy (surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy) for operable breast cancer.

    "text": "TOI between the two treatment groups (median score\nchange from baseline +2.9 for both anastrozole and\ntamoxifen; P=0.65). Consistent with the 2-year analysis,\nQoL was maintained, or slightly improved, during thetreatment period for both anastrozole- and tamoxifen-\ntreated patients [ 42].\nFACT-B in combination with ES was also used to assess\nQoL in a substudy of the IES [ 43]. In IES, relapse-free\npatients ( n=4724) were randomized, after 2\u20133 years\u2019\ntreatment with tamoxifen, either to continue their existing\nregimen or to switch to exemestane. In both arms, the total\nduration of adjuvant therapy was 5 years. Switching toexemestane was associated with a signi\ufb01cant 24% reduc-\ntion in the combined endpoint of disease recurrence,\ncontralateral breast cancer and death, compared withtamoxifen continuation. Switching to exemestane also\nachieved a borderline 17% survival bene\ufb01t in the subgroup\nof patients with ER +/ER-unknown disease ( P=0.05),\nbut no signi\ufb01cant survival bene\ufb01t in the exemestane group\nas a whole [ 48].\nThe 2-year QoL substudy recruited 582 patients from\nthe IES trial. As in the ATAC trial, treatment with either\ntamoxifen or AI was not associated with a clinically\nimportant mean change in TOI from baseline to 2 years.Additionally, there were no statistically signi\ufb01cant\nbetween-group differences in the change in TOI versus\nbaseline at any time point beyond 6 months. Thus, neithertreatment had a clinically meaningful effect overall (posi-\ntive or negative) on QoL over 2 years, suggesting that the\nclinical bene\ufb01ts of switching to exemestane are achievedwithout sacri\ufb01cing QoL.\nThus, evidence from large randomized trials suggests\nthat the clinical bene\ufb01ts of AIs, in terms of reduced diseaserecurrence and incidence of contralateral breast cancer, are\nachieved without any signi\ufb01cant reduction in overall QoL.\nThe results from maturing clinical trials can enable muchmore positive conversations with patients about the bene-\n\ufb01ts of adjuvant treatment.\nThe GAEA initiative\nPatients\u2019 attitudes to, and knowledge and understanding of,\nendocrine adjuvant therapy were investigated recently in apan-European survey of 547 postmenopausal women, all of\nwhom were receiving tamoxifen or an AI\u2013\u2013the GAEA\n(Gathering information on Adjuvant Endocrine ther Apy)\nInitiative [ 49].\nIn this survey, \\30% of the women received information\npertaining to the side effects of adjuvant therapy, or on therisks of disease recurrence, either during or after com-\npleting therapy. Additionally, less than half recalled being\ninformed of the available treatment options, and only 36%had any involvement in the decision to start adjuvanttherapy [ 49]. Women aged B60 years, those with a higher\nlevel of education and those with internet access were more\nlikely to have received information, or to have been\ninvolved in the decision-making process. Interestingly,women indicated that their most important sources of\ninformation and support were doctors and breast cancer\nsupport groups; printed, patient-oriented materials such aslea\ufb02ets and brochures were considered much less valuable.\nThese results suggest that women with breast cancer are\noften neither given suf\ufb01cient information about adjuvant\nendocrine treatment, nor told what to expect in terms of\noutcomes and side effects. Fewer still are involved in thedecision to start treatment. These results are particularly\ninteresting in the context of a randomized clinical trial\nconducted by Whelan and colleagues [ 27], which showed\nthat women who received detailed information about their\ndisease, adjuvant treatment options and likely outcomes\nwere signi\ufb01cantly more knowledgeable, and more satis\ufb01edwith the decision-making process, than those who did not\nreceive such information.\nExtended adjuvant therapy\nAt the present time, letrozole is the only AI licensed for use\nin patients who remain disease-free after 5 years\u2019 treatmentwith tamoxifen. At this point in their treatment, women\nmay be reluctant to continue with adjuvant therapy because\nof concerns about short- and long-term toxicities, incon-venience, cost and perceived lack of need. Recalling such\nwomen to discuss extended adjuvant therapy may, in itself,\ngenerate anxiety, and sensitivity is necessary to avoidcausing distress. Perhaps more than at any other stage in\ntheir treatment history so far, patients will need to balance\nthe potential bene\ufb01ts and risks of continued adjuvant\ntherapy, and decide for themselves whether or not to pro-\nceed. Uppermost in many patients\u2019 minds will be the\npotential effects of extended adjuvant therapy on theirQoL, particularly in relation to menopausal symptoms.\nMA.17 was a large ( n=5187) clinical trial in which\npostmenopausal women who were free from disease afterapproximately 5 years of tamoxifen therapy were ran-\ndomized to receive either placebo or letrozole for an\nadditional 5 years [ 50]. After a median of 2.4 years\u2019 fol-\nlow-up, letrozole was associated with a signi\ufb01cantly\nreduced risk of disease recurrence or contralateral breast\ncancer, compared with placebo (hazard ratio 0.57;P=0.00008). Additionally, the estimated 4-year disease-\nfree survival rate was signi\ufb01cantly higher for those\nreceiving letrozole than for placebo recipients (93% vs.87%, respectively; PB0.001).\nThus, extended therapy with letrozole signi\ufb01cantly\nimproves disease-free survival and reduces disease recur-rence; but are these bene\ufb01ts achieved at the expense of10 Breast Cancer Res Treat (2008) 112:5\u201313\n123",

    "text": "QoL? To answer this question, the impact of extended\nletrozole treatment on QoL was studied in 3612 of the\nwomen in MA.17, using the 36-item Short Form Health\nSurvey (SF-36) and the Menopause-Speci\ufb01c Quality ofLife (MENQOL) questionnaire [ 44].\nThe 36 items in the SF-36 are divided into eight\ndomains: physical function, role-physical, bodily pain,general health, vitality, social function, role-emotional and\nmental health. The results are used to generate two scores,\nthe Physical Component Summary (PCS) and the Mental\nComponent Summary (MCS), changes in which can be\nused to gauge the impact of an intervention on QoL. TheMENQOL questionnaire is designed to assess the severity\nof symptoms related to the menopause or estrogen depri-\nvation, and is divided into four domains: vasomotor,physical, psychosocial, and sexual. Increases in MENQOL\nquestionnaire scores indicate a worsening of symptoms\nand/or QoL; in contrast, higher SF-36 scores indicate animprovement in QoL.\nIn MA.17, letrozole did not adversely affect overall\nQoL. Although PCS and MCS scores decreased betweenbaseline and 36 months for patients receiving letrozole,\nscores decreased by a similar amount among patients\nreceiving placebo. With respect to the individual domainsof the SF-36, there were statistically signi\ufb01cant between-\ngroup differences in the mean score change versus baseline\nfor 3 of the 8 domains, but the differences were small, anddid not occur at all time points (bodily pain at 6 months;\nphysical function at 12 months; and vitality at 6 and\n12 months).\nMENQOL questionnaire results showed improvement in\nvasomotor symptoms in both treatment groups from base-\nline, with no signi\ufb01cant difference between the groups at36 months. Changes from baseline in the physical and\npsychosocial domains were similar for letrozole and pla-\ncebo (scores increased in both groups); sexual function didnot change in patients receiving placebo, whereas scores\ndecreased signi\ufb01cantly among those receiving letrozole\n(P\\0.0001).\nThe investigators also conducted a response analysis,\nwith the aim of determining the proportions of patients with\nimproved, stabilized, or worsened QoL on treatment, com-pared with baseline. Most women in both treatment groups\nhad either improved or stabilized physical and mental\nfunctioning (SF-36) during the study, with no statisticallysigni\ufb01cant differences between the groups (Table 2).\nIn summary, these data suggest that extended adjuvant\ntherapy with letrozole does not affect overall QoL,although there may be small changes in some areas such as\nsexual functioning; any negative effects need to be\nweighed against the bene\ufb01ts of therapy in preventing dis-ease recurrence and increasing the probability of disease-\nfree survival.Treatment decision-making in advanced breast cancer\nReceiving a diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer is often\ndevastating for patients, as it signals the development of\nincurable disease. Maintaining QoL is of the utmostimportance; the expected toxicities of aggressive treatment\ndictate that such an approach may be neither appropriate\nnor desirable, and the care team must take the wishes of thepatient and her signi\ufb01cant others into account when making\ntreatment decisions. Emotionally, patients will experience\n\ufb02uctuations in mood and signi\ufb01cant distress following their\ndiagnosis, and may \ufb01nd it dif\ufb01cult to maintain a sense of\ndignity and control; they may also feel isolated as a resultof their disease. On top of this, disease-related symptoms\nmay compromise patients\u2019 QoL, and limit their ability to\nperform everyday activities.\nSoon after diagnosis, physicians should discuss the\nimplications of metastatic disease, taking time to explain\nthe available therapeutic options (which are not limited tocytotoxic chemotherapy, see Table 3), the aims of these\noptions (e.g. symptom control, survival prolongation,\nmaintenance of QoL), and their expected bene\ufb01ts andadverse effects.\nPreferences for involvement in decision-making in\npatients with advanced cancer appear variable, though ingeneral approximately two-thirds of patients would like to\nhave some degree of active participation [ 51]. A study of\ndecision-making for palliative chemotherapy suggested thata patient\u2019s involvement in treatment choice was in\ufb02uenced\nby the stage of their disease progression. Patients who were\noffered \ufb01rst-line chemotherapy were more likely to have hada passive role in the decision-making process, despite\nseeking more information, compared with patients who were\noffered second-line chemotherapy [ 52].\nTypically, the information needs of patients with breast\ncancer fall into \ufb01ve categories: (i) the nature of the disease,\nits natural history and prognosis; (ii) treatment; (iii) diag-nostic and investigative tests; (iv) preventive, restorativeTable 2 Results of the response analysis (SF-36; PCS and MCS) in\nthe MA.17 study [ 44]\nTreatment Placebo (%) Letrozole (%)\nPCS\nImproved 21 21Stabilized 41 39Worsened 38 40\nMCS\nImproved 24 23Stabilized 43 41\nWorsened 33 36\nMCS, Mental Component Summary; PCS, Physical Component\nSummaryBreast Cancer Res Treat (2008) 112:5\u201313 11\n123",

The substantial growth in the number of breast cancer patients has put great pressure on health services. Meanwhile, the\ninformation patients need has increased and become more complicated. Therefore, a comprehensi ve and in-depth understanding\nof their information needs is urgently needed to impro ve the quality of health care. However, previous studies related to the\ninformation needs of breast cancer patients have focused on different perspecti ves and have only contrib uted to individual results.\nA systematic review and synthesis of breast cancer patients\u2019 information needs is critical.\nObjecti ve: This paper aims to systematically identify , evaluate, and synthesize existing primary qualitati ve research on the\ninformation needs of breast cancer patients.\nMethods: Web of Science, EBSCO, Scopus, ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library , the Cumulati ve Index to\nNursing and Allied Health Literature were searched on February 12 and July 9, 2019, to collect relevant studies. A Google Scholar\nsearch, interpersonal netw ork recommendations, and reference chaining were also conducted. Eligible studies included qualitati ve\nor mixed-methods studies focusing on the information needs (across the cancer continuum) of breast cancer patients or their\nsocial netw orks. Subsequently , a Critical Appraisals Skills Programme checklist was used to assess the quality of included\nresearch. The results, findings, and discussions were extracted. Data analysis was guided by the theory-generating meta-synthesis\nand grounded theory approach.\nResults: Three themes, 19 categories, and 55 concepts emer ged: (1) incenti ves (physical abnormality , inquiry from others,\nsubjecti ve norm, and problems during appointments); (2) types of information needs (prevention, etiology , diagnosis, clinical\nmanifestation, treatment, prognosis, impact and resumption of normal life, scientif ic research, and social assistance); (3) moderating\nvariables (attitudes, health literac y, demographic characteristics, disease status, as well as political and cultural environment).\nThe studies revealed that the information needs of breast cancer patients were triggered by different incenti ves. Subsequently ,\nthe patients sought a variety of information among different stages of the cancer journe y. Five types of variables were also found\nto moderate the formation of information needs.\nConclusions: This study contrib utes to a thorough model of information needs among breast cancer patients and provides\npractical suggestions for health and information professionals.\n(J Med Internet Res 2020;22(7):e17907) doi: 10.2196/17907\nKEYW ORDS\nbreast cancer patients; information needs; incenti ves; moderating variables; meta-synthesis\nJ Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 7 | e17907 | p. 1 https://www .jmir.org/2020/7/e17907\n(page number not for citation purposes)Lu et al JOURN AL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX",

    "text": "Introduction\nBreast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed malignant\ntumors worldwide [1]. In 2018, around 2.1 million new female\nbreast cancer cases were diagnosed worldwide, accounting for\nalmost 25% of the cancer cases among women [1]. In the United\nStates, an estimated 42,260 breast cancer deaths were predicted\nin 2019 [2]. The dramatic growth in the number of breast cancer\npatients has led to an increasing need for information to manage\nsymptoms [3], make decisions, control lives, and prepare for\nthe future [4]. However, information needs have not been\nthoroughly examined. For example, a lack of targeted education\nmaterials has been reported in clinical practice [3]. Several\nlarge-scale patient investigations have identif ied inadequate and\ninaccessible patient information [5]. Therefore, it is crucial and\nchallenging for health service providers to systematically\ninvestig ate patients\u2019 information needs and offer relevant\ninformation.\nWe identify two existing reviews on breast cancer patients\u2019\ninformation needs. A review of relevant literature published\nbetween 1988 and 1998 classif ied individual studies to examine\ninformation needs and source preferences of breast cancer\npatients and their family members at different points in their\ncancer journe y [6]. They found that essential information needs\nchanged over time, and family members also needed information\nto support the patients. A recent protocol for a scoping review\nhas been put forw ard that aims to summarize studies exploring\ninformation needs, source preferences, and engagement\nbehaviors of women with a specif ic breast cancer type\n(metastatic) [5]. However, it does not address the specif ic\ninformation needs of general breast cancer patients, and no\nfurther findings have been published. Therefore, there is no\nupdated review and synthesis of breast cancer patients\u2019\ninformation needs.\nThere is a large body of qualitati ve studies that have mainly\ncollected data through intervie wing and nonparticipatory\nobserv ation on this topic. These studies contrib ute to an\ninsightful understanding of patients\u2019 information needs and\ncharacteristics [7], but they have mostly focused on particular\ntopics with limited samples and produced mixed results. For\nexample, different results have identif ied the information needs\nof patients in specif ic age groups [8,9]. Therefore, a qualitati ve\nmeta-synthesis will help to address the mixed results and\nestablish a general model of the information needs of breast\ncancer patients.To narro w these gaps, this study aims to identify , evaluate, and\nsynthesize existing primary qualitati ve research on the\ninformation needs of breast cancer patients and generate an\nintegrated model to articulate their information needs (ie,\nincenti ves, types and moderating variables) across the cancer\ncare continuum. The findings can inform health professionals\nand information service providers to help breast cancer patients\nrecei ve appropriate information and be well equipped to cope\nwith the disease.\nMethods\nThis study follows the processes of theory-generating\nmeta-synthesis [10] and grounded theory [11].\nSear ch Strategy\nThe search strate gy was first developed for Web of Science\n(Clari vate Analytics) and then adjusted to search EBSCO,\nScopus, ProQuest, PubMed, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library ,\nand the Cumulati ve Index to Nursing and Allied Health\nLiterature. These databases were chosen based on related studies\n[12,13]. In addition, a Google Scholar search, interpersonal\nnetw ork recommendations, and reference chaining of the\nincluded articles were applied. The literature search was\nconducted on February 12, 2019, and updated on July 9, 2019.\nDuplicate articles were remo ved.\nSearch terms were chosen from two categories: breast cancer\npatients and information needs. The search terms were chosen\naccording to MeSH vocabulary [14] and related research on\ninformation behavior [15-20] (see Multimedia Appendix 1for\nthe detailed search strate gies). \u201cBeha vio*, \u201d \u201cseek*, \u201d \u201csource*, \u201d\nand other words were added so all related studies could be\nidentif ied since findings on information needs may have also\nbeen covered in information behavior research (eg, what\ninformation did the patients search?). Limits on research\nmethods were not initially placed on the search terms since it\nwas difficult to accurately identify all qualitati ve studies when\nsearching for the literature on this topic in the databases [21].\nTherefore, qualitati ve studies were selected in the screening\nprocess.\nSelection Criteria\nArticles were selected according to inclusion and exclusion\ncriteria [12,13] (Textbox 1).\nJ Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 7 | e17907 | p. 2 https://www .jmir.org/2020/7/e17907\n(page number not for citation purposes)Lu et al JOURN AL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX",

Themes\nemer ged after an in-depth analysis and classif ication of\ncategories. Third, concerning the evidence found in the extracted\ndata, all themes were integrated according to their logical\nrelationship. Finally , a model clarifying the information needs\nof breast cancer patients was built.\nResults\nOverview of the Literatur e\nIn all, 47 journal articles were included. The characteristics of\nthe included studies are shown in Multimedia Appendix 2. The\ndata collection methods used in these studies were\nsemistructured intervie ws, focus groups, observ ations, an online\nsurvey, and/or an open-ended questionnaire. Most studies\napplied thematic analysis, content analysis, and grounded theory\nto analyze the data. The recruitment strate gies were generally\nconvenience sampling and purposi ve sampling. These studies\nwere conducted in the United States (13), Australia (12), United\nKingdom (7), Canada (10), Turkey (1), Japan (1), Iran (1),\nPoland (1), and Switzerland (1). As for the populations, 26\nstudies reported the race of the participants, among which 18\nstudies focused mainly on white participants (over 60%), and\n6 studies recruited all Asian participants (eg, Japanese and\nChinese-Australian). Participants of one study were all African\nAmerican. In addition, one study recruited mixed participants\nsuch as Asian, white, and Filipino. In terms of the types of\ninformation patients sought, the studies revealed that participants\nwanted information from various sources, encompassing\ninformation from health care providers (47); peers/support teams\n(24); the internet (18); books (14); cancer organizations (13);\nfamilies (13); friends/co workers (13); brochures and pamphlets(12); magazines (9); audio/videos (7); complementary ,\nalternati ve, or uncon ventional practitioners (6); newspapers (4);\nlibraries (3); television (3); telephone hotlines (3); medical\nrecords (2); and broadcasts (1). In addition, 10 studies used\ntheoretical frame works, such as planned behavior theory and\nsocial learning theory , in their research.\nSynthesized Findings\nSummary\nThree themes emer ged to articulate the developing process of\ninformation needs of breast cancer patients, with 19 categories\nand 55 concepts underpinning the themes (Table 1). This study\nalso explored the logical relations between themes and built an\nintegration model (Figure 2) guided by incenti ve theory [23].\nAccording to the theory , individual activities are not only\nderived from internal motivation but are also stimulated by\nexternal factors, including positi ve and negative incenti ves [23].\nThe process of diagnosis and treatment in breast cancer patients\u2019\njourne ys is sequential [24] and often accompanied by various\ndiagnostic approaches and treatment regimens in a clinical\nconte xt [24]. Therefore, diagnosis and treatment were\nsynthesized as one stage in this study (phase 2). Consequently ,\nwe identif ied another two phases. Phase 1 is the stage before\ndiagnosis: before going to the hospital for medical advice or\nexamination in allusion to physical abnormalities. Phase 3 is\nconceptualized as survi vorship. Incenti ves and content of\npatients\u2019 information needs vary in each of the phases. In\nparticular , 7 studies reported the content and incenti ves of\ninformation needs before diagnosis (phase 1), while 44 studies\nfocused on diagnosis and treatment (phase 2) and 29 studies\npresented information needs during survi vorship (phase 3).\nVariables moderating the formation of information needs are\nalso shown in the model.\nJ Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 7 | e17907 | p. 5 https://www .jmir.org/2020/7/e17907\n(page number not for citation purposes)Lu et al JOURN AL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX",

Model of information needs of breast cancer patients.\nTheme 1. Incentiv es\nThis theme illustrates how breast cancer patients formed a\ncogniti ve state of information gaps, which led to their\ninformation needs. These needs were triggered by various\nfactors.\nPhysical Abnormalities\nBreast cancer patients might experience physical abnormalities\nanytime during the cancer continuum. Their information needs\nwere often triggered by the appearance of symptoms of the\nprimary tumor (eg, lumps, pain, or dischar ge) [9,26,28,31-33,36]\nbecause patients\u2019 panic and uncertainty increased before\ndiagnosis. Nine studies also reported side effects caused by the\ntreatment (eg, irregular menstruation, arm complications,\nfatigue, sexual dysfunction, lymphedema, and pain)\n[25,27,29,30,32,34,35,37,38] that would last from the treatment\nto the survi vorship stages and could lead to specif ic information\nneeds.Inquiry From Others\nThree studies suggested that doctors provided patients with\nseveral surgery choices and asked patients to quickly make\ntreatment decisions (in phase 2), resulting in information needs\nabout treatment [26,32,39]. During treatment (in phase 2), a\npatient wished that she had asked doctors more questions\nbecause she could not answer the queries of patients around\nher, indicating that other patients\u2019 questions helped form\ninformation needs that some patients themselv es were not aware\nof [36]. In the survi vorship stage, a patient was asked questions\nby general people around her, which reminded her of the risk\nof a recurrence, leading her to go back to the clinic for a\nfollow-up appointment [31].\nSubjecti ve Norm\nPatients\u2019 information needs were also triggered by subjecti ve\nnorms (\u201cthe belief that an important person or group of people\nwill appro ve and support a particular behavior\u201d [70]).

For example, during the process of treatment\ndecision making, the long waiting period between diagnosis\nand making a final treatment decision made it difficult for\npatients to remember all the information discussed, thus\ngenerating more information needs [25]. In addition, the doctors\nsometimes did not provide patients with enough information\nabout breast cancer treatment options and simply made the\ntreatment decision without discussion with the patient, which\nleft the patient with more uncertainty [41]. The patients also\nhad many questions (eg, who and how often should they see\nthe doctor) as they transitioned from the cancer care group to\nthe primary care physician shortly after treatment (in phase 3)\n[30,37]. Patients were also confused when health care\nprofessionals provided them with inconsistent information (eg,\ntamoxifen discontinuation) in the survi vorship stage [30],\ntriggering the need for more exact information. In a follow-up\nappointment (in phase 3), it was reported that the doctor\u2019 s\nindifferent attitude also led to patients\u2019 anxiety and uncertainty\nwhen doing a routine examination [30].\nTheme 2. Information Needs\nThis theme refers to specif ic information patients needed. The\nincluded studies suggested that breast cancer patients generally\nhad 9 types of information needs at different stages of cancer\ncare including information on prevention, etiology , diagnosis,\nclinical manifestation, treatment, prognosis, impact on normal\nlife and coping, research progress, and social assistance. The\ntypes of information needs can be divided into several concepts.\nPrevention\nThree studies reported that patients were concerned about\ninformation on prevention, including effectiveness of breast\nself-e xamination [40] in phase 2. Patients reported that they\nalso needed information about prevention for family members\n[30,42,43] during the survi vorship stage.\nEtiology\nEtiology information was needed throughout the whole cancer\njourne y. Four studies reflected on this type of information need.\nFor example, patients wanted to know about internal and\nexternal factors (risk factors) before diagnosis in phase 1 [36]\nand phase 2 [40]. Patients also needed information on internal\n(genetic) [42,44] and external factors (possible carcinogens and\nenvironmental triggers) [44] in the survi vorship stage in phase\n3.\nDiagnosis\nIn the diagnosis and treatment phase (in phase 2), patients were\nconcerned about specif ic biopsy procedures (arrangement,\ntemporal sequence, and actual procedure) [45], pathologic results\n(results of the biopsy) [45], and precision and applicability of\nthe examination tools [9]. They also wanted an explanation of\ntechnical terms related to the diagnosis (used to describe tumor\ntypes) [46], pathologic results (pathological stage or the type\nof breast cancer) [36,43,46], clinical stage [36,40], waiting timeof diagnostic tests, and the corresponding impact on prognosis\n[47].\nClinical Manifestation\nPatients wanted to know about the signs of breast cancer\n(symptoms of the primary tumor) [36] before diagnosis (phase\n1). Information about the meaning of the corresponding\nsymptoms was needed by patients who were under going a breast\nbiopsy (in phase 2) [45]. They also needed to be informed of\nthe symptoms of the side effects caused by the treatment [30,37]\nduring phases 2 and 3. Eight studies also reported that patients\nwere concerned about symptoms of a recurrence (symptoms of\nthe primary tumor) [30,33,37,43,44,48-50] during phase 3.\nTreatment\nPatients needing treatment information during the cancer\ncontinuum was commonly reported across studies (n=44): 23\nstudies found that patients needed treatment options while\nwaiting for diagnosis results [45], shortly after recei ving\ndiagnosis results [36,40,51], and during the treatment decision\nprocess [8,9,26,28,31,32,34,39,40,42,46-48,52-59] such as\npopularity , advantages and disadv antages, risks, applicability ,\nrecovery time, comparison, cost, and optimal time of different\ntreatment options in phase 2. Twelv e articles also mentioned\nthat patients wanted to be educated about the side effects of\ntreatment [8,9,25,28,31,36,40,46,56,60] when considering the\ntreatment decision. The information needs of patients during\ntreatment preparation included details about treatment\npreparation [33,42,48,52] and treatment procedures\n[9,25,28,30,42,46,61,62].\nDuring treatment, patients\u2019 information needs focused on the\nside effects of treatment [25,47] and management of the side\neffects [8,25,38,40,46,49,50,53,60,63,64]. The studies also\nreported that patients needed details on the treatment options\n(alternati ve and complementary medicines and treatment)\n[25,65] and treatment procedures (eg, location of the pharmac y)\nduring treatment [28,40,42,46,53,57,61]. In the survi vorship\nstage, patients also paid attention to information on side effects\n[8,29,30,32,33,36-38,41,42,48] and management of side effects\n[25,30,35,37,43,48,49]. In phase 3, patients needed information\nabout treatment options (eg, complementary and alternati ve\ntherapies) [42,44,64,65] and treatment evaluation summaries\n[43,48]. In addition, patients wanted information about\npreventing a recurrence (eg, prevention-related policies, signs\nand symptoms of a recurrence, natural remedies to prevent\nrecurrence, preventive health actions to minimize the risk of a\nrecurrence) [30,33,37,41-43,49,52,61,66] in the survi vorship\nstage.\nPrognosis\nPatients\u2019 need for prognosis information included general\nsurvi val rates [26,47,51,54] and the risk of a recurrence [27] in\nphase 2. Studies also found that patients desired information\nabout the risk of complications [42], risk of a recurrence [31,46],\nand survi val statistics of treatment regimens [55,59] when they\nmade treatment decisions. In particular , patients needed to know\nthe risk of a recurrence in phases 2 [47] and 3 [30,32,66].\nJ Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 7 | e17907 | p. 8 https://www .jmir.org/2020/7/e17907\n(page number not for citation purposes)Lu et al JOURN AL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX",

    "text": "Impact and Resumption of Normal Life\nPatients wanted to know how to communicate about the cancer\nwith their family members in phase 2 [9,26,52,67,68]. Patients\nalso needed information about the impact of treatment on their\nown body image [28,32,33,35,42,62,69], fertility (or menopause)\n[8,35], work [25,26], and psychology [8,26,64] in phase 2. In\nthe survi vorship stage, patients were concerned about the impact\nof treatment on work [44,52], intimate relationships [44,69],\nfertility (or menopause) [9,30,44], psychology [42,44,69], and\nbody image [9,27,34,35,69]. In 26 studies, strate gies to impro ve\npatients\u2019 quality of life (eg, fertility preserv ation options, sex\nadvice, instructions about diet and exercise, stress management,\nreconstruction) were important for patients in both phase 2\n[9,26,27,35,38,39,47,51,53,56,60-62] and phase 3\n[29,30,32,36,41-44,48,63,64,69].\nScientif ic Resear ch\nSome patients needed information about recent breast cancer\nresearch findings [40] and clinical trials [47,65] in phase 2.

In this study , attitudes included affect, behavior,\nand cognition. Affect represented the strong feelings of breast\ncancer patients, such as being shock ed and worried [28,57],\nwhile behavior described their readiness to recei ve information\n[25]. Cognition was the product of knowledge acquisition or\napplication, such as an understanding of breast cancer .\nSix studies showed that patients\u2019 cognition and affect influenced\nthe development of information needs. For example, some\npatients misunderstood the causes and risks of breast cancer ,\nbelie ving that they would not have breast cancer after a certain\nage [33] or after breastfeeding [36], and thus they did not seek\ninformation. Correct cognition of patients facilitated the\ndevelopment of their need for information. For example, patients\nwent to see their physicians after disco vering a lump or feeling\npain [9,26,28]. Two studies showed that affect also influenced\ntheir information needs. For instance, some participants who\nfound a lump and felt shock ed immediately went to the hospital\nto seek medical advice [28,57], while those who were not\nworried about the lump only described the symptoms when they\nwent to see their general practitioner for other diseases or they\nchose to completely ignore the lump [28].\nIn addition, some patients who belie ved that they were still in\nthe process of recei ving diagnosis results were not willing to\nprocess a large amount of information [25]. Patients who lacked\nbehavior intention chose to avoid information [25], while other\npatients asked for various types of information [8,35,46,48].\nHealth Literacy\nHealth literac y is defined as individuals\u2019 ability to obtain,\nunderstand, evaluate, and apply health information, which can\naffect individual judgments and decisions on health care and\ndisease prevention [72]. In the study , this category included\nhealth beliefs, health knowledge, and health styles, respecti vely,\nrepresenting patients\u2019 values toward breast cancer , awareness\nof cancer -related information in order to seek appropriate health\nservices [73], and their coping strate gies for breast cancer .\nFor example, one patient did not go to see a doctor after\ndisco vering a lump in her breast because she lacked health\nknowledge about the effect of screening tools (mistak enly\nbelieving that routine mammographic screening had a preventiveeffect), which inhibited the development of her information\nneeds [33]. Relati vely abundant health knowledge could promote\nthe articulation of the need for information [33,40]. While one\nwomen who had a different health style also ignored the\ndisco very of lump until she found that the lump was getting\nbigger 3 month later, other patients went to see a doctor\nimmediately after feeling breast pain [33]. In terms of health\nbeliefs, some of the patients suspected breast cancer immediately\nafter finding the lump, but they were not worried or did not ask\nabout it because of fatalism [28,33] whereas other patients\nsought further examination [9,26,34].\nDemographic Characteristics\nEight studies reported that the patients\u2019 age, education level,\nand financial situation moderated the formation process of their\ninformation needs. For example, young patients cared more\nabout new treatments, research advances, and effects of\ntreatment on fertility and career compared to older patients\n[8,25,44]. Younger patients also expressed a greater need for\ninformation about complementary therapies, dietary changes\nand exercise, possible carcinogens, and environmental factors\nof breast cancer because of their interest or a sense of control\nand comfort [44]. In contrast, some older patients had less need\nfor information and considered that the less they knew, the less\nthey were bothered about it [28]. In general, patients with a\nlower education level were more likely to trust doctors and be\nsatisf ied with the information provided by their doctors [40].\nThese patients belie ved that they did not need more information\nand had fewer information needs than other groups [40]. In\nterms of education levels, having a high education level had a\nbenef icial effect on information needs and they independently\nresearched areas such as medical terminology and medical\ninformation systems [40]. Furthermore, patients with lower\neconomic status showed no concern about health y diet\ninformation due to the high costs as well as the conflicts between\na special diet and their family\u2019 s diet [42]. In contrast, others\ncared about natural health products and health y dietary changes\n[57,64]. It was also found that worse economic status and older\nage inhibited their need for information on reconstructi ve\nsurgery [42].\nDisease Status\nDisease status involved comorbidity and the clinical stage of\npatients.

    "text": "secondary prevention was needed to avoid complications [42].\nFor example, obese patients faced a higher risk of recurrence,\nand they needed targeted survi val guidelines based on their\nphysical condition [41]. Patients with advanced breast cancer\nalso wanted to know about the experiences of other patients in\nthe same clinical stage [60]. They also sought information or\nsupport related to the last will and testament and final\narrangements [60].\nPolitical and Cultural Environment\nThe political and cultural environment refers to the social and\ncultural conte xt characterized by a community\u2019 s values and\nbeliefs [74]. Of the included studies, 6 suggested a moderating\neffect of cultural background and health care polic y. Patients\nwho were influenced by Chinese culture developed more\ninformation needs regarding specif ic recommendations on diet\nand exercise related to symptom management, promotion of\nrehabilitation, and prevention of recurrence [38,49] because of\nthe traditional food therap y culture. Some Chinese patients\nreported no feeling about postoperati ve body changes because\nbody image was not as important to them as returning home to\ntake care of their families in the conte xt of Chinese culture [33].\nIn contrast, patients in some other countries like Turkey [35]\nand Japan [32] attached great importance to the aesthetic needs\nof the female body image. In addition, for patients from some\ncountries with religious beliefs like Turkey with strong\nopposition to abortion, the cultural beliefs directly affected the\npatients\u2019 need for contracepti ve information [35]. Patients in\ncountries that had experienced changes in the national health\ncare polic y (eg, national cost curtailment polic y) and\ncorresponding adjustments in practice (eg, frequenc y of routine\nexaminations) needed more targeted information on these\nchanges [30].\nFamily Factors\nIn addition to the moderating variables described above, one\nstudy found that patients who had younger children often talked\nabout the lack of personalized information for their kids [9].\nThey particularly needed targeted information on how to guide\ntheir communication about breast cancer with their children\nbecause they had difficulty finding age-appropriate information\n[9].\nDiscussion\nPrincipal Findings\nThis meta-synthesis strengthens our understanding of the\nformation and types of information needs of breast cancer\npatients. It also highlights the variables moderating the\ndevelopment of information needs.\nInformation Service Targeted on General Breast Cancer\nPatients\nFigure 2shows that breast cancer patients\u2019 information needs\nchange over the three stages. Patients are often given substantial\nresources (eg, brochures, books, and nursing plans) but the\ninformation has disadv antages in both content and form.\nTargeted messages are often embedded in a large amount of\nirrele vant information. Breast cancer patients are also oftengiven overwhelming information during hospitalization, putting\nextra pressure on them [75]. In addition, the information is not\nalways delivered in expected, easy-to-digest forms, but is often\nfilled with medical jargon, for instance [3]. This study provides\nsome practical recommendations based on synthesized findings\nto guide medical professionals attempting to provide better\ninformation for breast cancer patients.\nIn this synthesis, breast cancer patients\u2019 information needs were\nsystematically examined and classif ied into three cancer phases.\nThis can help us understand the changing process of the specif ic\ninformation needed by patients at different phases. The\nsynthesized findings also inform recommendations for health\ncare staff to offer relevant and timely education materials at the\nappropriate stage of the cancer journe y. A total of 94% (44/47)\nof the studies reported that patients were concerned about\ntreatment information such as treatment procedures, side effects,\nand preoperati ve preparation. This type of universal information\nshould be incorporated into education materials to help patients\nmake proper treatment decisions. The synthesis also revealed\nthat it is difficult for patients to obtain information about\nfinancial assistance [9,26,30,52,60], as well as complementary\nand alternati ve therapies [34,64]. More attention should be given\nto meet these information needs.\nEasy-to-understand materials are also recommended since much\nthe existing information and oral communication seems to\ncontain comple x medical language [76]. Education programs\nusing virtual reality technology could also increase the\nknowledge and positi ve experience of patients [77]. Graphics\nand tables can also help patients understand the cancer care\ninformation.\nInformation Services Targeting Specific Groups of\nBreast Cancer Patients\nAttitudes of Patients\nThe synthesis revealed that patients\u2019 attitudes greatly affected\ntheir information needs [9,25,28,46]. Numerous other studies\nhave also verified this view. For instance, individual cultural\nbeliefs, views on health and disease, and other factors could\naffect women\u2019 s dealing of early diagnosis [78,79], which is an\nessential strate gy for preventing breast cancer [80,81]. Emotional\ndistress may also affect patients\u2019 ability to cope with the\nsymptoms and treatment of cancer [82].\nTo date, doctors have not paid enough attention to the emotional\npressure patients feel when confronted with a diagnosis and\ntreatment of breast cancer [83]. Thus, social support (eg, support\ngroups, online health communities, and eHealth mobile apps)\ncan play an active role in assisting patients with stress\nmanagement and providing high-quality care [84,85]. Health\ncare staff can also provide psychological support for breast\ncancer patients [86] by providing more mental health\ninformation. They can also encourage patients to express their\ngenuine emotions and be willing to listen [87]. Finally , it is\nnecessary for medical staff to give full respect to patients and\nprotect their privacy [61].\nJ Med Internet Res 2020 | vol. 22 | iss. 7 | e17907 | p. 12 https://www .jmir.org/2020/7/e17907\n(page number not for citation purposes)Lu et al JOURN AL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH\nXSL\u2022FO\nRenderX",

    "text": "Health Literacy of Patients\nThis study found that breast cancer patients\u2019 information needs\ncan be influenced by health literac y [28,33,34]. Patients with\nlimited health literac y commonly had more unsatisf ied\ninformation needs [88]. Health literac y could also influence\npatients\u2019 cancer screening knowledge, attitudes, and behavior\n[89]. Inaccurate health beliefs or lack of health knowledge could\nlead to patients overlooking physical abnormalities, which could\naffect early detection and treatment of diseases.\nPeople can often detect and treat breast cancer early by\nimpro ving their health literac y. A higher level of health literac y\ncan also promote effective communication with medical staff\nand increase patients\u2019 engagement in medical decisions [90].\nFor patients, limited literac y is associated with a low education\nlevel and socioeconomic status [91]. For medical practitioners,\nthe knowledge of prevention, causes, early symptoms, and\nself-e xamination methods could be communicated better through\nmass media to impro ve patients\u2019 awareness [92]. Furthermore,\neducational materials on breast cancer prevention should be\nsensiti ve to health beliefs [93] to reduce women\u2019 s fears of breast\ncancer screening and fatalism toward the disease. Physicians\nand other health care providers should continue to give priority\nto patients\u2019 quality of life when determining treatment plans as\npatients\u2019 decisions may be influenced by health knowledge.\nAdditional training would help doctors communicate more\neffectively with patients with low health literac y and reduce\nmedical inequalities.\nDemographic Characteristics, Disease Status, and Political\nand Cultural Environment of Patients\nThe signif icant increase in the number of breast cancer patients\nhas resulted in diverse and comple x information needs. For\nexample, there were more unmet information needs among\nbreast cancer patients who had a foreign native language\nbackground (eg, immigrants) [94]. Moreo ver, the age-specif ic\ninformation needs of younger breast cancer survi vors is still far\nfrom satisf actory [95]. Therefore, tailored information is\nrecommended to help subgroups of breast cancer patients cope\nwith cancer and impro ve satisf action levels [96].\nAs shown in Table 2, this synthesis reveals suggestions and\nimplications for tailored information services. First, some studies\nsuggested that information provided to younger patients could\nfocus more on the impact of treatment on fertility [8,9,35,44],lifestyle, and career as well as corresponding coping strate gies\n[25,44,52]. More detailed advice on diet could also be provided\nfor patients including many Asian patients. Patients who have\nyoung children can also be educated on how to communicate\nwith their children. If patients are adequately informed about\nbody changes before treatment, those who care a lot about body\nimage [32,35] might have more time to consider and prepare\nfor the changes. Polic y information should also be given to\npatients who live in a country with changing medical policies.\nFor patients with comorbidities and other physical conditions,\nspecif ic prevention and survi val guidelines are vital. Since\ndifferent treatment options have corresponding side effects,\nhealth prescriptions that are targeted to each type of treatment\ncan be distrib uted to patients separately to help them impro ve\nsymptom management.\nLimitations\nWhereas the findings of this study offer signif icant insights, the\nlimitations can lead to recommendations for further study . Some\nof the included studies did not clearly report cancer stages,\nmaking it difficult to analyze the findings according to the\ntimeline of the disease journe y. In addition, this\ntheory-generating meta-synthesis only focused on qualitati ve\nstudies, which could lead to the omission of valuable findings\nin quantitati ve research. Further research is needed to fully\nunderstand the unique information needs of breast cancer\npatients at all stages of their journe y.\nConclusions\nThis synthesis has identif ied different information needs at\nvarious stages of the cancer continuum. Among the information\nneeds, patients generally pay more attention to information\nabout treatment and prognosis, as well as impact and resumption\nof normal life. Moderating variables were also identif ied. The\ngenerated model describes a complete pattern of the formation\nof information needs. Thus, this study contrib utes to a deeper\nunderstanding of breast cancer patients\u2019 information needs and\nprovides practical suggestions for health professionals and\ninformation service providers. In particular , health care providers\ncan offer educational materials according to the information\nneeds identif ied in this study . More personalized information\ncan also be developed to tailor patients\u2019 needs with reference\nto the moderating variables that influence their information\nneeds.\nAckno wledgments\nHL designed the search strings and conducted the search.

    "text": "Information needs of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer\nof treatments, impact on family, self-care, efFect on social hfe and sexual\nattractiveness Profiles of information needs were produced to take account of\ndifferences m age, level of education and social class The use ofthe profile as a\nchmcal reference guide to assist nurses and others to provide targeted\ninformation to individuals is discussed\nINTRODUCTION\nOver the last two decades a great deal has been wntten\nabout the role of the nurse as a patient educator or teacher\nFor a review of the hterature see Luker & Caress (1989)\nand Redman (1993) The emphasis on patient teaching in\nthe nursmg hterature has focused on the process of edu-\ncation, rather than on the content The assumption has\nbeen that nurses know what patients need to know, and\nhave the necessary information to impart Similarly, httle\nattention has been given to what patients and mdividuals\nwant to know and what their pnonty mformation needs\nare It is the case, owing to reduced lengths of stay, that\nless time is available while a patient is m the hospital for\ninformation giving or education in its broadest sense\nThere is a need to find out more about patients' own con-\ncerns and pnonties for information, so that the short time\nm hospital is used to the patients' best advantage This\npaper sets out the pohcy context for focusmg on the service\nuser The study reported may be seen as redressmg the\nimbalance m the literature by focusmg on the information\nneeds of one patient group, namely women newly diag-\nnosed with breast cancer\nBACKGROUND\nIncreeismg emphasis is being placed on promotmg effective\ncommunication between health care professionals and ser-\nvice users Empowenng people, encouraging active par-\nticipation in decision making and promoting autonomy\nhave been embodied m the National Health Service and\nCommunity Care Act (Department of Health 1990), the\nPatients Charter (Department of Health 1991b) and the\nHealth of the Nation consultative document (Department\nof Health 1991a) Service users' nghts are now a more\ntangible issue and nurses have a key role to play in\nempowerment and information giving\nInformation giving is an essential element m makmg lay\nparticipation effective In order for people to feel comfort-\nable participating in decisions about health care, it is\nimportant that they are adequately informed Hence, the\nt}^e of information an mdividual has access to may be the\nkey to the process of empowerment Health care pro-\nfessionals arguably have a responsibility to provide indi-\nviduals with the specific type of mformation necessary for\ninformed decision makmg to take place\nReceiving the nght amount and t3rpe of information isparticularly important for people with cancer A cancer\ndiagnosis is still regarded with more fear than other diag-\nnoses, mstilhng feelmgs of shock, gnef, uncertainty and\nloss of control (Northouse & Northouse 1987, I^rry 1990,\nScham 1990) Fear and apprehension often mean that mdi-\nviduals are reluctant to ask for specific information, believ-\nmg that they will be told all they need to know The subject\nof cancer is an emotionally loaded area and nurses often\nfeel lumted in their ability to communicate effectively\n(Wilkmson 1991, Suommen 1993) For doctors there is the\nconcem that they will upset the person or dispel hopes\nfor a cure (Slevm 1987) and death is still a taboo subject\nthat some doctors feel ill prepared to discuss (Katz 1984)\nIn the context of cancer there has been a shift from not\nmformmg people of their diagnosis to fully informing them\n(Novack et al 1979) However, it still appears that people\nare not receiving as much information as they would wish\nand on the areas that they perceive to be important\n(Simmoff 1989, Simmoff et al 1989, Simpson et al 1991,\nHack etal 1992)\nProvidmg adequate information to women with breast\ncancer is of particular importance since a choice of treat-\nment may exist for many Treating breast cancer with mas-\ntectomy, compared to treatment with more conservative\nsurgery followed by radiotherapy, has no demonstrable\ndifference in terms of long-term survival (Fisher et al\n1985) Providing women with a choice of treatment has\nbeen found to be of benefit m terms of long-term adjust-\nment to the diseeise (Lemster et al 1989) To facilitate the\ndecision-making process adequate information must be\nprovided or women may feel ill-prepared to take on the\nrole of decision maker\nIt has been suggested that younger, more highly edu-\ncated individu\u00a3ils with a diagnosis of cancer have a greater\nneed for mformation emd want to be more actively\ninvolved in the decision-makmg process (Cassileth et al\n1980, Amir 1987) Results from these studies need to be\nexeumned in detail as there are many diseases, for example\nbreast cancer, where mcidence mcreases with age and\ninformation needs may well vary for different age groups\nDecision-making process\nIt should be noted that although mformation is an import-\nant aid to decision making, it should not be assumed that\nnon-participation m decision makmg relates to a wish for\nless information Information may still be required to\n\u00a9 1995 Blackwell Science Ltd, Joumal of Advanced Nursing, 22, 134-141 135\n

spanning 20\nyears, relabng to communication with cancer pabents,\nNorihouse & Northouse (1987) concluded that seeking\nmformation was one of the major areas of importance for\nindividuals with cancer However, few studies reviewed\nconcentrated on the type of mfonnabon required, and evi-\ndence suggests that the focus of attenbon has been on the\nquanbty of lnfoimabon required, rather than on the type\nof mformabon or the way m which mformabon is given\n(Tuckett & Williams 1984)\nAssumptions are made that health care professionals are\naware ofthe mformation needs of individuals with cancer\nEmpincal evidence suggests that there is a difference m\npercepbon of what the person wants to know and what\nthe health care professionai thinks the person wants to\nknow (Lauer et al 1982, GIVIO 1986), with mformabon\noften bemg perceived by people as unhelpful rather than\nconstrucbve and supporbve (Thome 1988) The service\nuser's perspecbve is therefore of paramount importance if\nwe are to provide adequate mformabon to facilitate\ninformed decision making If we want to involve people\nwith cancer m the communication process, then we need\nto find out from them what it is that they need to know\n(Reynolds ef ai 1981)it would be prudent to examme the pnonty information\nneeds at key pomts m the illness trajectory to prevent over-\nloading people with mformabon that they v\u00abll not be able\nto recall at a later date\nAn extensive review of the literature cained out in\nCanada ldenbfied items of mfonnabon that were important\nto people with cancer generally and, more particularly,\nwith breast cancer (Degner et al 1989) The literature\nrevealed mne major areas of importance for women\nwith breast cancer These areas mcluded physical,\npsychological and social aspects ofcare and treatment, and\nincluded mfonnabon on the spread of disease, likelihood\nof cure, impact on social life, effect on family and friends,\nself-care, sexual attracbveness, treatment opbons, nsk to\nfamily of gettmg the same disease, and treatment side-\neffects\nTime IS a valuable resource for nurses, and all health\ncare professionals, and to use the limited bme aveulable to\nthe increased benefit of service users would enhance\ncommmucabon through an increased awareness of what\nthe individual considers to be important m terms of\ninformation\nIn summary, it is important for nurses as pabent edu-\ncators to provide useful and appropnate mformabon to\nthe pabents m their care This applies equally to other\nhealth care professionals, and a multi-disciplmary\napproach to health care, in the context of cancer, should\nbe encouraged The provision of information can be com-\nplicated m the hospital environment by limitabons on\nbme available for lmparbng mfonnabon A knowledge of\nwhat the pabent really weints to know, that is the content\nof the mformabon, can only make information giving a\nmore effecbve and worthwhile process\nTHE STUDY\nThe present study aimed to establish the priority mfor-\nmabon needs of a sample of women newly diagnosed with\nbreast cancer, and to assess if mformabon need was\ninfluenced by variables such as age, level of educabon and\nsocial class\nAssessing information needs\nImparting the right type of information is obviously of\ngreat importance, but it should be noted that there have\nbeen many problems m assessing mformabon needs since\npeople tend to say that they want as much mformabon as\npossible about all aspects of their care and treatment This\npresents particular problems for nurses and other health\ncare professionals, as time is often limited in the hospital\nenvironment due to decreased lengths of hospital stay and\ncompebng demands on health care professionals' time\nAttenbon and recall have been shown to be severely lim-\nited in hfe-threatening situabons (Cimpnch 1993), henceMethod\nA consecubve sample of 150 women newly diagnosed\nwith breast cancer was taken from a consultant's list m a\nlarge umversity teachmg hospital The sample represented\n116% ofthe total number of women newly diagnosed with\nbreast cancer in the Mersey Regioned Health Authonty\n(MRHA) (Youngson et al 1992) A sample of 200 women\nwith benign breast disease was recruited to provide a con-\ntrol group for the study Ethical approval for carrying

model assumed that when two stimuli were\npresented together they could be ranked m terms of some\nattnbute In the present study that attnbute was perceived\nimportance Thurstone proposed that each item would\nvary m terms of the attnbute under lnvesbgabon, so that\neach Item will not have a fixed posibon on the profile at\nall bmes and its posibon will fiuctuate That is, each indi-\nvidual may vary in their judgement of an item from one\nmstance to the next, but overall there will be a most fre-\nquently occumng response Thurstone referred to this\nmost frequently occumng response as the

of\ninformation needs, for newly diagnosed women with\nbreast cancer tbat would reffect the pnonty needs around\nthe time of diagnosis\nTbe study clearly demonstrated tbat the pnonty infor-\nmation

bierarcby were, m descending order\nof importance, information about the nsk to fanuly of\ngettmg the disease, information about tbe side-effects of\ntreatment, information about tbe emotional impact

remamed low\nregardless of the age of the womanIt may be important to direct attenbon, during the hospi-\ntal admission, towards the items that assumed major\nimportance m terms of rank order However, this is not to\nsay that an mdividualized approach to pabent care is not\nwarranted What tbe study highlights is the important\nmformabon needs of women, and we suggest that the pro-\nfiles of mformabon needs (Figures 1 and 2) may t>e a useful\ngmde m pracbce m terms of assisting nurses to pnontize\nteaching and mformabon giving All bealtb care pro-\nfessionals have lumted tune available

importance may save time for tbe\nnurse and provide the pabents with the mformabon they\nneed\nIMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE\nArguably, the top three mformabon needs found to be of\nimportance to women newly diagnosed with breast cancer,\nnamely likelibood of cure, spread of disease and treatment\nopbons, are not witbm tbe remit of the average ward nurse\nas far as mformabon giving is concerned However, they\nmay fall witbm the scope of pracbce of tbe specialist breast\ncare nurse An assessment of the mformation needs that\nare important to tbe pabent is within tbe remit of every\nregistered nurse's role, and an awareness of pabents' needs\nIS vital for promotmg high quality care If mdeed tbe top\nthree items of mformabon are considered of pnonty to a\npabent, tben tbe nurse could act as facilitator, enabling\nthat pabent to gain access to tbat mformabon by, for\nexample, making medical colleagues aware of tbe pabent's\nmformabon needs This may, m some cases, lead to tbe\ndevelopment of protocols or guidelines for mformabon\ngiving\nThese findmgs bave further lmpbcabons for nursmg\npracbce Informabon giving is often focused on the time\nof diagnosis and hospital admission and nurses play a lead\nrole A mastectomy or lumpectomy is a time of cnsis, when\nretenbon and recall of informabon may be severely limited\n(Cimpnch 1993) Given that the average length of hospital\nstay for women with breast cancer is 2-3 days, there is a\nneed to provide mformabon that is perceived as relevant\nThis study highlighted the importance of survival issues\nfor women at the time of diagnosis, and studies camed\nout m tbe USA and Canada have also found survival issues\nto be a major concern for women with breast cancer\n(Northouse 1989, Bilodeau 1992) Overwbelmmg the\npabent with informabon that they see as low pnonty, for\nexample on sexual attracbveness and body image, may not\nbe prudent at this time It is clearly important to under-\nstand when

This study aims to explain the \nperception of  women with breast cancer in terms of \ntheir communication needs.\nMETHODS\nAccording to the research question, qualitative \nresearch method with the approach of  conventional \ncontent analysis to explain the understanding of  the \ncommunication needs of  women with breast cancer \nwas used. Conventional content analysis is an inductive \napproach that aims to describe the phenomenon on the \ngrounds of  encoding and extraction of  categories from \nthe available data.[21] Using this method, an in\u2011depth \ninvestigation of  the patients\u2019 real\u2011world experiences and \nbehaviors and an explication of  the notion in question \nhave been provided.\nSetting and participant selection\nThe study population consisted of  women with breast \ncancer referrred to palliative care or oncology wards, their \nfamily caregivers, and health\u2011care providers. In this study, \nthe research setting was based on the type of  qualitative \nresearch, real and natural environments and places \nwhere cancer patients were available. This being so, the \nstudy was carried out across the Shohada\u2011ye\u2011Tajrish and \nTaleghani Hospitals of  Tehran (capital of  Iran) affiliated \nto Shahid Beheshti University of  Medical Sciences as \nreferral centers of  cancer patients from around the \ncountry. Women diagnosed with breast cancer and their \nfamilies\u2019 caregivers who knew about the disease and were \nable to speak Farsi, were selected based on purposive \nsampling method. The criterion for the selection of \ncare providers was at least 1 year of  work experience in \nthe oncology clinics and departments. To collect data, \nin\u2011depth semi\u2011structured interviews were conducted \nusing open\u2011ended questions. The researcher explained \nto the participants the aim of  the study and after their \noral consent to participate in the study; the place of \ninterview was selected after consulting the participants. \nSince patients were considered the key participants in \nthis study, and to comply with maximum flexibility, we ",

Interviews \ntook between 30 and 90 min per session, and from June \nto July 2015 and continued until data saturation was \nreached, i.e., no new categories emerges, and to round off  \nanalysis.[21] Using central questions, the researcher studied \nthe participants\u2019 experiences and their understanding of \nthe subject to be studied. Sample interview questions \nfrom the participants were shown in Table  1.\nData analysis\nThe process of  data analysis was carried out in accordance \nwith the recommended steps by Graneheim and \nLundman.[22] Interviews were transcribed and recorded \nwith the permission of  the participants and was read many \ntimes. Initial codes were extracted. The codes were then \nmerged and classified on the basis of  similarities. Finally, \nboth the concept and content of  the data were extracted. \nData collection and analysis, using MAXQDA 10 software, \nwere done simultaneously.\nFollowing analysis, four criteria of  Lincoln and Guba: \nCredibility, confirmability, dependability, and transferability \nwere used to evaluate the qualitative research.[23] In \nthis study, in a bid to solidify the reliability of  data, the \nresearcher was in continuous involvement with the data for \n1 year during the study period, and all the data and interview \ntranscripts and the list of  categories were reviewed by \nother researchers with qualitative research background, \nand coded under control process by the members of  each \ninterview. The initial coding of  each interview was returned \nto the interviewee at the early stage of  analysis to determine \nthe accuracy of  data. However, the confirmability of  the \ndata was verified by two auditors familiar with qualitative research. As for the validation of  the research, the \nresearcher accurately recorded and reported the research \nsteps and procedures to make it possible to investigate the \nresearch by others.\nEthical considerations\nTo observe ethics in research, an informed consent form \nwas completed by all the participants after seeking approval \nfrom the relevant hospitals. At the beginning of  the \ninterview, the purpose of  research, method of  interview, \nconfidentiality of  the data, and their freedom to enter \nor exit the study was explained to the participants. The \ntime and place of  interviews were also coordinated with \nthe participants so that they could fit it into their routine \nschedule and thus having ample time for interview and \nparticipation.\nRESULTS\nIn this study, 20 participants consist of  9 women with breast \ncancer, and 6 physician and 4 oncology nurses and 1 family \ncaregiver were analyzed. The average age of  patients was \n43/36 years (range 35\u201361). 8\u201380 months had passed since \nthe initial diagnosis. Seven of  nine patients underwent total \nmastectomy, one of  them underwent breast\u2011conserving \nsurgery and one breast lumpectomy.\nA total of  clinical nurses were recruited (3 females and \n1 male) from oncology ward and supportive/palliative \ncare clinic of  the Shohada\u2011ye Tajrish and Taleghani \nhospitals (affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of \nMedical Sciences), holding a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing \nand married. Furthermore, six physicians (2 general \npractitioners from cancer Clinic, 2 surgeons, and \n2 oncologists) whose work experience ranged from 3 to \n21 months (average 10 months) were included.\nAfter continuously analyzing and comparing the data \nand the subcategories, two main categories: \u201ctherapeutic \ncommunication\u201d and \u201cfacilitating empathy\u201d were extracted \nwhich is the outcome of  the experience and understanding \nof  the participants. The description is as shown in Table  2.\nTherapeutic communication\nThe need to establish communication between the \nhealth\u2011care team and patients is important so much so that \nit helps streamline treatment; as viewed by the participants. \nThe participants need to communicate with patients, and \ntheir health\u2011care team is of  paramount importance to keep \npace with, and thus improve treatment. \u201cTrust\u2011building Table 1: Sample interview questions\nThe patients questions: What did/do you expect when you visited/visit a clinic \nor hospital?\nWhich behaviors gave/give you a feeling of calmness \nin the hospital or during the time when you were \nhospitalized?\nThe care providers \nquestions:What behaviors caused them satisfaction with care?\nExploratory questions: Tell me more I\nCan you explain what you mean?\nCan you tell me what you\u2019re worried about?

A  sound \npatient\u2013physician relationship based on trust, reduces \npatients\u2019 fears and anxiety, thus will lead to their satisfaction \nand preservation of  their spirit.\n\u201cThe very first time I went into get my pathology report, \nmy legs became numb from knees down, and sat on the \nstairs fearing that it was cancer that knocking the door. \nThe doctor said in a comforting and kind tone that I \nwas facing a disease which should be worked out in \ntandem\u2026.it would be completely cured if  you wanted \nso. With complete serenity on the side of  the doctor, I \ngot the feeling it was not meant to have a mortal fear of  \ncancer.\u201d (P1)\nTo the participants, good humor and friendly behavior \nmainly account for factors in building trust between the \npatient and the therapist. The most important conduct \nwhich the patients expect from their doctors and caring \nnurses, in the process of  chemotherapy, was the practice \ncode of  ethics and appropriate treatment; the patients need \n\u201ccheerfulness,\u201d \u201csincerity,\u201d and \u201cgood temper.\u201d Patients\u2019 \nexperiences show that whenever treatment is associated \nwith kindness and cheerfulness, the patient would \nexperience a sense of  trust toward the health\u2011care team.\n\u201cJust the physician coming in cheerfully and asking me how \nyou are today Miss Maryam\u2026feels great\u2026having trust for \ncancer patients are everything.\u201d (P4)\nDuring the course of  the research, some of  the participants \nbelieved that doctors\u2019 ill temper and failure of  initiate \ncommunication were the main obstacles of  the treatment \nfollow\u2011up: \u201cEvery patient has a particular problem with this \ndisease, and doctors do not set the scene for the patient to \ntell her improper conduct.\u201d (P3)\nBelieving the pain and discomfort of  the patient and being \nsensitive to the needs and conditions was a demand by \nother patients.\u201cI used to go to hospital. my oncologist was very cranky \nand didn\u2019t spend enough time for none of  her patients. \nI could not even say I had mouth sores. She said everybody \nhas the same problems, It is not just you, so stop moaning. \nsince then, I stopped seeing her.\u201d (P7)\nSoothing presence\nTo the patients, physical presence and availability of \nhealth\u2011care providers, particularly nurses, caused relief \nand maintained morale and satisfaction in them. Patients \nexpressed a soothing presence of  the nurse through \nwords such as availability, talking, touching and caring, \nand paying attention to their questions and expressed \ntheir appeals. \u201cThe nurse was by my bedside anytime I \nneeded her.\u201d (P5)\nA nurse with 19 years of  work experience in the oncology \nward believed that understanding the needs of  patients \nand presence is in a way an art of  nursing. She says: \n\u201cA woman who has cancer, and underwent multiple courses \nof  treatment, might not wish to communicate. Here, the \nsituation calls for her facility to understand the patient and \nthe patient, on the other hand, comes to the conclusion \nthat we will be beside her till the end.\u201d (P7)\nNurse\u2019s presence at the bedside is so important that it leads \nto trust, intimacy, and mutual peace. Patients believe that \nnurses\u2019 absence causes a feeling of  loneliness and anxiety.\n\u201cOne night I was suffering from severe nausea. The \ncaring nurse kept coming to my bedside hundred times \nuntil morning. I am dead sure she did not sleep the whole \nnight. She held my hand and asked how I felt. the pain \ndiminished. the following day I was keen to see my nurse \nagain.\u201d (P3)\nAs also asserted by the care providers, physical presence \nand availability of  the nurse will have an important role in \ncalming the patient, to the extent that it is part and parcel \nof  the nursing major mission statement. \u201cThese patients \nare very sensitive. emotionally imbalanced, and are often \nagitated and anxious. I always try to sit and talk with them \nanytime I am free because it is very closely intertwined with \nour mission. the important thing is that you are available \nto patients and check them up from time to time, and feel \nthem when you are next to him/her even for 2 or 3 min \nor 3 min.\u201d (N9)\nCrying out to be heard\nOf  other communication needs associated with cancer \npatients, pointed out over and over, is the need to Table 2: Analysis of Data\nSubcategories Category\nConfidence\u2011building Therapist\ncrying out to be heard\nSoothing presence\nSharing knowledge\nsupportive peersTherapeutic Communication\nFacilitating Empathy",

A patient admitted at the final stages of  her illness, \nbeing understood by the nurse helps reduce pain and \nincreases the hope of  recovery.\n\u201cGrinding my teeth, morphine had no effect on the severe \nbone pain and my nurse understood me very well. She told \nme I should beat cancer, many patients were cured in this \nway. If  there is hope, the drugs would work better\u2026this \nmade me feel less pain.\u201d (P6)\n\u201cBased on my experience, there ought to be a strong \nrelationship with mutual understanding between the patient \nand the care provider. I had a patient who was in her final \nstage of  her disease, after talking to her, I could see a \nsmile on her face\u2026.in other words, she was happy. Nurses \nare duty\u2011bound to create hope for the future in them by \ndeveloping positive thoughts.\u201d (N4)\nFacilitating empathy\nDespite having disease\u2011related functional limitations and \nsocial activities, most patients underlined the need to \ncommunicate with their peers about sharing experiences \nacquired during disease process including the treatment \nsigns and complications as well as the influence of  peers \nin boosting morale and thus help them overcome social \nwithdrawal and isolation. Therefore, another category \nwhich was extracted in this study was labeled facilitating \nempathy, which itself  is divided into two subcategories: \n\u201csharing knowledge\u201d and \u201csupportive peers.\u201d\nSharing knowledge\nPatients believe that sharing and transferring one\u2019s \nknowledge, acquired personally in the course of  treatment, \nat individual level is the core component of  individuals\u2019 \nknowledge dynamics and will lead to an increase in the \noverall knowledge of  individuals.\n\u201cI always told the people around me or other patients \nabout what symptoms I experienced when I was on \nTamoxifen.\u201d (P5)\n\u201cI\u2019ll be glad to tell other patients about the experiences I \nlearned thus far\u2026. I think that\u2019s helping them a lot.\u201d (P6)\nSupportive peers\nPatients and caregivers often find ways to talk with people \nwho have similar experiences to help them out with \naccepting and realizing the symptoms they might encounter \nduring the course of  the disease.\u201cThe news of  my breasts having been removed made me \nfeels desperate. I blurted out that it would be much better \nfor me to die. but then I found out that there were many \nfolks out there just like me and I am not the only one. I got \ninto a conversation with one of  the ladies and gradually \naccepted the truth\u2026. my spirit was there again.\u201d (P2)\nOne family caregiver (patient\u2019s daughter) of  one of  the \npatients, on the issue of  guiding and helping another \npatient\u2019s companion, says: \u201cI came to know a lady at the \nhospital prayer room whose mother suffered from breast \ncancer too. She explained to me about the complications \nof  the disease and what she has done for her mother\u2026and \nthat which doctor was better. She even gave me her cell \nphone number just in case.\u201d Patient\u2019s daughter.\n\u201cBeing with other ladies who have similar conditions \n(whose breasts have been removed) are very good. there \nshould be a place to get together and express our problems, \nor even on a sight\u2011seeing tour\u2026this way the spirit of  joy \nand happiness comes back to us.\u201d (P3)\n\u201cWe, a couple of  ladies, decided to cooperate with a charity \nand do everything that we could for the others\u2026tell them \nthat they are not alone and we can defeat cancer\u2026. what \nI mean is that these types of  groups are very helpful so \nmuch so that folks like me will be able to make it back to \nthe predisease life.\u201d (P5)\n\u201cThe development of  this type of  group was supported by \nclose association of  people who have experienced cancer \nin that it facilitates sharing experiences with each other and \nthus helps reduce fear as well\u2026. we should help and bring \npatients together.\u201d (P10)\nDISCUSSION\nThe purpose of  the present study was to explore the \nperception that patients with breast cancer had regarding \ntheir communications needs. Main categories emerged \nfrom the analysis of  the participants\u2019 experiences relating to \nthe communication needs of  the patients with breast cancer \nincluding \u201ctherapeutic communication\u201d and \u201cfacilitating \nempathy.\u201d\nOne of  the main categories in this study was \u201ctherapeutic \ncommunication\u201d which is regarded as an interaction \ninterspersed with trust, respect, and good manners, being \namiable and approachable among health\u2011care personnel, \nespecially doctors and nurses in providing care for patients \nwith breast cancer and especially women who underwent ",

However, a couple of  issues raised by the \nparticipants in the study were discussed including aspects \nsuch as trust\u2011building care provider, crying out to be heard, \nand soothing presence. Participants in the study expected \nmedical team to listen to them, and understand their needs, \nbelieving that trust was the cornerstone of  the therapeutic \ncommunication to improve the quality of  primary medical \ncare provision imbued with satisfaction. When patients \nrealize that their health\u2011care needs are neglected by the \nhealth\u2011care providers, they would be disheartened, and \nlose hope down the road. Hence, these findings shed light \non the importance of  understanding the communication \nneeds of  patients. Therapeutic communication means \nutilizing specific strategies to encourage patients to \nexpress feelings and ideas, transference, acceptance, and \nrespect for the patient.[24] Therapeutic communication is \nthe process of  initiating interpersonal communication \ntoward providing better care and compatibility with both \ndisease and treatment, with a view to developing the best \npossible quality of  life in women with mastectomy.[7] \nCommunications are the core requirement for setting the \nhealth\u2011care goals. Yet, studies have shown that patients are \nnot satisfied with the mode of  communication established \nbetween them and their physicians.[25] In line with the \nresults, the study by Esbensen et al., attributed the related \nfactors to effective communication between medical staff  \nand patients, doctor\u2019s good temper, empathy, and listening \nof  the treatment team to the problems of  patients, talking \nto the medical team, especially nurses, having the skills to \ncommunicate effectively to the presence of  the nurse.[26] \nIn addition, the ability of  physicians to build trusting \nrelationship accounts for one of  his communicative skills.[27] \nFurthermore, physician manner and answering to patients\u2019 \nquestions are the main factors involved in building trust \nin them. These findings are consistent with the results \nreported in other studies.[28,29] In Iran, doctors are patients\u2019 \nconfidante, and since time immemorial, patients expect the \ndoctors to restore their health after God. Hence, physician\u2019s \nestablishing good relationship with patients and making \nthem sure of  their health condition is the patients\u2019 greatest \nneed. On the other hand, as in this context, the relationship \nbetween doctor and patient is very limited because doctors \nare reluctant to disclose any diagnosis of  cancer to the \npatient. Therefore, proper relation between them cannot \nbe established upfront.[30]\nIn connection with the subcategories crying out to be heard \nand soothing presence, participants regard the need for \nnurse\u2019s constant presence and empathy, in the treatment \ncourse of  disease and care, as one of  the factors boosting \nmorale, hope in the future, and calmness. In line with \nour study, the results of  the research by Molazem et al., 2011,[31] indicate that patients comfortable at the nurse\u2019s \npresence and availability. The need for nursing presence is \nthe main theme in a study by Yagasaki and Komatsu which \nis considered an important factor in chemotherapy so that \nthe nurses are expected to be present for developing and \ncoordinating patient care programs as well as facilitating \ninterpersonal relationships among health\u2011caregivers, \nwhereas being proactive in the arena of  preventive care and \nprojecting the future needs of  patients including checking \nthe side effects.[32] Bright believes that the presence of  a \nnurse, even a physical presence minus therapeutic action \nat times when treatment and palliative care fall short of  \nthe patient\u2019s needs, can change the quality of  care from the \npatient\u2019s perspective.[33]\nAs viewed by the participants in the study, the nurse\u2013patient \ncommunication is an intrinsic characteristic of  the nursing \nmission and that, as a strong factor, provides calmness \nand recovery in patients. Therefore, sympathy on the part \nof  nurses with patients has been viewed as one of  the \nfundamental needs by cancer patients.[34] From the point of  \nview of  participants in the study, it means understanding \nconcerns of  patients by physicians or nurses, indicating the \nsubcategory of  \u201ccrying out to be heard.\u201d In addition, it has \nbeen pointed out that to develop clinical communication \nwith patients and their families, nurses should try to a spirit \nof  empathetic communication.[35] As such, it can be said that \nfor a mutual relationship and trust between the patient and \nthe nurse both sides need to adapt to their needs, and thus \ndevelop a fair relationship based on honesty and empathy.\nFacilitating empathy is another category extracted during \nthe study. Most participants have noted the desire and the \nneed for communication with peers, saying that sharing \nexperiences and describing symptoms to peers boosts \nmorale and helps to have a sense of  usefulness and a \ndeeper social interaction. To confirm these findings, ample \nevidence shows that social support, including peer support, \nis known to be the key element in reducing stress caused \nin the wake of  cancer experience.[36]\nIn addition to highlighting the role of  peers in the present \nstudy, patients with breast cancer beleive that sharing \ntheir experiences with their peers would boost morale \nand raise awareness. Most of  the participants in this \nstudy preferred to communicate with their peers obtain \ninformation about the disease; they compare their own \nsituation with them, learn from and teach them, and \nbuild morale and respond reciprocally. Toward that end, \nseveral studies on cancer patients indicate the positive role \nof  peer support groups, stating that those patients who \njoin cancer support groups are more active, and exercise ",

In \na study of  cancer patients, a high level of  growth has been \nevidenced.[42] Previous studies had also shown that cancer \npatients in terms of  \u201cRelating to Others\u201d have experienced \ndegrees of  their growth.[43] Current study also suggests that \nthe need to communicate with peers in the cancer patients \nwas even higher, and this is quite indicative of  a rise in the \nlevel of  attention and communication with individuals in \nIran when they face problems including cancer. Despite the \nneed felt by cancer patients for a high\u2011profile presence of  \npeers, there exist no support programs for cancer survivors \nand their families in Iran including psychosocial support \nand peer support programs. That may be due to the lack \nof  guidelines, policy\u2011making (planning), and professional \ntraining for care providers.[44]\nOne limitation of  this study was that the qualitative research \nresults cannot be generalized to the society, but can help \nprioritize the care provision for the cancer patients as well \nas the caring method, attitude, and interactions on the part \nof  the health\u2011care personnel.\nCONCLUSION\nIn this study, the need for effective communication based \non trust and ethical standards associated with nurses\u2019 \npresence has been highlighted by patients diagnosed \nwith breast cancer. Therefore, considering the results, the \ngravity of  identifying communicative needs of  patients and \ntheir families by health\u2011care personnel for the purpose of  \nmaintaining health, and developing as well as improving \neffective coping skills are highlighted. In addition, the \ninteraction between nurses and doctors has to be addressed \nin depth to improve the quality of  patients\u2019 quality of  care.\nGiven the role of  peer groups in support of  patients with \nbreast cancer, initiation of  group treatment methods, based \non sharing experiences with each other, and communication skills training workshops, to raise awareness and develop \ntherapeutic communication skills for both nursing and \ntherapy team, are recommended.\nFinancial support and sponsorship\nNil.\nConflicts of  interest\nThere are no conflicts of  interest.\nREFERENCES\n1.

Epstein and Street \u2019s patient-centered communication in cancer care (PCC) model provides a useful\nframework. The model incorporates six domains representing core mediating functions of patient-centered\ncommunication (Fostering healing relationships, Exchanging information, Responding to emotions, Manag-\ning uncertainty, Making decisions, and Enabling self-management) and additional moderating factors forPCC and health outcomes.\nData Sources: Data sources include peer-reviewed articles sourced from electronic databases.\nConclusion: Common complex interrelated reasons for poor engagement include fear, denial, fatalism,\nbereavement, advanced disease, and poor clinician /C0patient relationships. This can have serious implications\nfor physical and emotional outcomes. Facilitators include open, trusting relationships between patients and\nnurses, timing of information, focusing on patients \u2019agendas, and understanding emotional concerns, beliefs,\nand motivations. Supporting patients and carers to work together, through evidence-based interventionsand tailoring approaches, for example to older people, are important.\nImplications for Nursing Practice: Patient information and engagement are important aspects of cancer nurs-\ning. Interventions are largely based on behavior change theory, but new translational research is needed todemonstrate effectiveness. Nurses need education on how to develop skills to effectively manage this com-\nplex process to effectively engage and educate patients.\n\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Challenges\ninclude other chronic conditions, vision or hearing impairments, and/\nor age-related cognitive decline.2These can impede patient engage-\nment and communication. At the same time, treatments for cancerare developing apace; contemporary treatment often entails complex\nand multiple lines of therapy, adding complexity to self-care\ndemands that patients face.\nSelf-care during and following treatment includes patients seek-\ning help in a timely fashion for new or concerning symptoms and\nside effects. Late presentation is of particular concern as this can\naffect morbidity and mortality. Factors including fear, denial, poormotivation, miscalculation of symptom severity, self-medication,\nadvanced disease, bereavement, fatalism, carer exclusion, and poor\nclinician relationships are established contributors.3-6Cancer nurses\nare crucial in supporting patients to self-manage physical and psy-\nchological consequences of cancer and its treatments.

The\nmodel incorporates six domains representing core-mediating func-\ntions of patient-clinician communication (Fostering healing relation-\nships, Exchanging information, Responding to emotions, Managing\nuncertainty, Making decisions, and Enabling self-management) and\nadditional factors moderating patient-centered communication and\nhealth outcomes.\nDomain 1: Fostering Healing Relationships\nThe PCC model suggests that therapeutic relationships between\nhealth professionals and patients embodying trust, honesty, open-\nness, and disclosure increase patients \u2019likelihood of engaging with\nself-care activities. Communication between professionals and\npatients can vary according to respective genders, ethnicity, age, and\neducational status. If they fail to connect, patients can be passive and\nsubmissive during consultations.12Further, some services themselves\ncan feel impersonal; chemotherapy services have been likened to a\nfactory by patients.3\nStudies show patients \u2019reluctance to contact clinicians they do not\nhave a good relationship with3,13or who have previously dismissed\nconcerns.14Others sometimes avoid bothering staff perceived as\nbusy3,13,14and/or contacting emergency helplines, opting instead to\nwait to see a member of staff they connect with.3\nPatient engagement can be encouraged through nurses \u2019active lis-\ntening, inviting patients to tell their stories and through relationship\nbuilding over time.10Cancer nurses are ideally placed to develop\ntrusting and healing relationships with patients through connecting\nwith them by enacting these behaviors, answering questions, solving\nproblems and concerns, and delivering information in a measured\nand constructive manner across multiple consultations; information\nthat includes key safety-related matters messages.\nDomain 2: Exchanging Information\nThis domain suggests that most people with cancer and their fam-\nilies seek information \u2014and by providing it, cancer nurses help rela-\ntionship building, patient decision-making, and uncertaintymanagement. Importantly, nurses should determine patients \u2019base-\nline knowledge and beliefs before imparting new information, be\nguided by patients \u2019and families \u2019agendas and concerns, and enhance\nmotivation and con \ufb01dence to engage in care.15This is aided when\nthe rationale for any desired behaviors is explained.3,16\nHowever, one UK study17incorporating nonparticipant observa-\ntion of interactions between clinicians, patients, and carers during\nchemotherapy, and another exploring delayed presentation with\nneutropenic sepsis,3found information delivery by clinicians often\ndispassionate, checklist-driven, assuming compliance, and poorly\ntailored to need or preference. This may be re \ufb02ective of busy clinical\nenvironments that can compromise effective information\nexchange.18\nTiming of information giving is also important. For example,\npatients can \ufb01nd information about neutropenic sepsis emotive and\nhard to assimilate before starting chemotherapy. It brings home the\nseriousness of a diagnosis and can exacerbate fears of dying.3This\nneeds to be factored into information exchange; information needs\nto be delivered sensitively, slowly, and returned to. Oakley et al\n(2017)3determined that many patients prefer to understand clearly\nsepsis risk, actions to mitigate risk, and likely scenarios should sepsis\nmanifest. Engagement can be engendered through asking what\npatients already know and what most concerns or frightens them. It\nis also important to assess barriers to learning including literacy, lan-\nguage, hearing, sight, or mental health issues, alongside any preferred\nlearning media (eg, paper, online, audio, or video). Whatever the\nmedia, use of clear straightforward language is imperative, and sum-\nmarizing is wise.\nTools that can enhance patient engagement include diaries,\ninformation sheets, alert cards, short \ufb01lms, and traf \ufb01cl i g h ts y m p -\ntom reporting tools.19,20Recent innovations include patient apps21\nand group consultations (these can be guided by learning facilita-\ntors); group discussions and exercises enable peer-to-peer learning\nthat patients and families can \ufb01nd therapeutic and helpful for cop-\ning. Delivery by learning facilitators, or by patient apps, can save\ncancer nursing resources.22It is also important to recognize the\naffect of increased use of oral therapies in the metastatic breast can-\ncer setting. The responsibility for self-medication and reporting of\nside effects can be overwhelming for patients who are also trying to\nmanage the symptoms of disease and SACT side effects. The tools\nmentioned here can help with patient engagement with oral\ntherapies.20,23,24\nDomain 3: Responding to Emotions\nResponding to emotions is necessary as fears about cancer and\ntreatments, and low mental mood generally, hinder successful infor-\nmation uptake and can lead to patients \u2019avoidance and poor engage-\nment in advisable self-care.3\nLow mental affect is common in patients with cancer. Global esti-\nmates suggest around 32% of people living with breast cancer (any\nstage) experience depression,25and 20 /C058% experience anxiety\naround diagnosis and during treatment.26\nAs mentioned, learning about neutropenic sepsis can heighten\ntreatment-related fears and fear of dying from cancer; these can beexacerbated in people with advanced disease and likely enhanced by\nconcerned clinicians repeatedly stressing the urgency of calling the\nhospital if becoming unwell.\n3Oakley et al (2017) found that repeated\niteration of urgency related to neutropenic sepsis failed to translate\ninto enhanced self-care or timely help-seeking.3\nThus, this domain suggests nurses should elicit emotional con-\ncerns before delivering information. This may be helped by reviewing\npatients \u2019notes to gain understanding of the person, their concerns,\nand context of their lives before starting nursing interactions. Check-\nlists should be used with care as they can convey lack of empathy\nand hinder rapport and patient /C0professional connection.3,17TABLE 1\nPatient Centered Communication in Cancer Care (PCC) Model Applied to the Role of the\nNurse in Patient Education and Engagement.\nMediating Domains of Patient-clinician communication\nFostering healing relationships: Therapeutic, trusting relationships between\npatients and nurses are likely to increase patient engagement in self-care activi-ties.\nExchanging information: Information delivery should be guided by patients and\nbuild on baseline knowledge and an understanding of beliefs. Tools to enhance\nengagement include: diaries; information sheets; alert cards; short \ufb01lms, traf \ufb01c\nlight symptom reporting tools; apps and group patient and carer education.\nResponding to emotions: Nurses should elicit and address concerns before deliv-\nering information. Depression, anxiety, and fears about dying can hinder infor-mation uptake.\nManaging uncertainty: Uncertainty and the associated fears of recurrence, disease\nprogression and potential for limited life can reduce patient engagement. Nurses\ncan assist through clarity eg, about treatment plans, likely side effects and side\neffect management to prepare for life during treatment.\nMaking decisions: Most patients prefer to make treatment-related decisions in\npartnership with clinicians through weighing up the pros, cons and their per-sonal beliefs. Nurses can support shared decision making by ensuring patientsand their families are well informed about the risks and bene \ufb01ts of treatment.\nEnabling self-management: Emotional, social, and demographic factors can\nimpact on patient engagement. Nurses can enable patients to be active and\nresponsible participants in their care through strategies including goal setting\nand preparation to manage and monitor symptoms and administer medications.\nPotential Moderating FactorsCarer engagement, older people, fatalism, having advanced disease and being\nbereaved.2 C.

    "text": "Domain 4: Managing Uncertainty\nUncertainty is the inability to accurately predict future illness\nevents or outcomes.27Cancer brings uncertainty, with its associated\nfear of recurrence or disease progression and potential for limiting\nlife. For people with advanced breast cancer dealing with uncertainty\nis an ongoing concern, impacting on many areas of their lives.28\nInability to predict symptoms, appraise them as normal/abnormal,and fears for the future evoke considerable distress,\n27,29diminish\nsense of control,27,30-32and engagement in self-care.3Uncertainty\ncan unwittingly be exacerbated by clinicians discussing uncertainty\nover complex therapeutic decisions, equivocal treatment outcomes,\nand revisions to staging or treatment required following new clinical\ninformation (to name but a few).\nPatients with cancer value certainty and those undergoing treat-\nment typically seek clarity over treatment plans, likely side effects,\nand side effect management33-35to prepare for life during it.13,34,36,37\nThe PCC managing uncertainty domain suggests cancer nurses should\ntarget information to individual patient needs and develop an\nagreed-on plan for dealing with uncertainty. Importantly, relation-\nships with carers, other patients, and clinicians can also modify\nuncertainty.38\nDomain 5: Making Decisions\nThis domain suggests that most patients prefer to make treat-\nment-related decisions in partnership with clinicians through weigh-\ning up pros and cons and their personal beliefs. This requires them to\nbe well informed about the bene \ufb01ts and risks of treatments and party\nto open and honest discussions with clinicians about them. Histori-\ncally, paternalism presided, and clinicians were observed underplay-\ning the seriousness of cancer or treatment side effects,39,40\npotentially resulting in mismatches between patients \u2019needs for\ninformation and that provided by clinicians. One study reported a\nclear mismatch between patients \u2019need for chemotherapy informa-\ntion and that provided by clinicians regarding chances of cure (94.6%\nversus 34.3%) and effectiveness of chemotherapy in other patients\n(90% versus 48.5%).41\nHowever, it appears that challenges persist over patients being\nsuf\ufb01ciently informed of either treatment risks, notably regarding\nneutropenic sepsis, and patients \u2019personal risk of developing it3,42or\nthat advanced cancer can develop after primary breast cancer treat-\nment.43Arguably, clinicians may limit information provided about\nsevere treatment side effects (eg, sepsis) over fear of patients refusing\nchemotherapy if fully explained.3However, some patients have\nbelieved that they suffered unnecessarily due to having insuf \ufb01cient\ninformation on managing chemotherapy symptoms.44This research\nhighlights signi \ufb01cant issues related to informed consent for chemo-\ntherapy and risks associated with power imbalances in favor of clini-\ncians during decision-making consultations.12\nIntentional nonadherence to oral chemotherapy self-medication\nfor breast cancer has been associated with women feeling out of con-\ntrol with treatment-related decision making.45This has clear conse-\nquences for patient safety and treatment ef \ufb01cacy; patient\nengagement in treatment decision-making can be critical. Tobiana et\nal (2020) in their review10highlighted the value of providing ongoing\ninformation about health status, investigations, and procedures and\nhelping weigh alternative choices during decision-making.\nDomain 6: Enabling Self-Management\nThe domain focuses on clinicians \u2019roles in enabling patients to be\nactive and responsible participants in care. Research suggests these\nroles can be enacted better in people with cancer. The study refer-\nenced previously3showed clinicians \u2019style of information giving\nabout neutropenic sepsis tended to frighten patients and inhibit theirtaking active responsibility for it.3A seminal piece of work by Ban-\ndura (1988)46identi \ufb01ed the association between negative stress reac-\ntions (like being anxious/frightened) and reduced ability to perform.\nIt is important to recognize that carers (family members/friends) are\nequally affected by treatment-related stress and that this can affect\nhow they perform in their caring role when deciding whether and\nwhen to seek help for an unwell patient.\nConditions for enabling self-management appear inadequate at\npresent. Engaging patients and their carers in patients \u2019care can, how-\never, be complex. Interventions for enabling it are generally under-\npinned by behavior change theory, but there is limited evidence of\ntheir effectiveness. Further, there is little training for cancer nurses in\nenabling self-management, and organizations generally do not facili-\ntate the integration of patient engagement into routine care.47,48Vul-\nnerable or marginalized groups may \ufb01nd it especially dif \ufb01cult to\nengage in care. A systematic review of self-management interven-\ntions for older people with cancer concluded that frailty compro-\nmises the ability to engage with self-management during cancer and\nthat few self-management interventions have been developed for\nthis group.49\nCancer nurses should assess patients \u2019ability for self-management,\nsuch as language issues, comorbidities, physical symptoms, educa-\ntional and social status, normal routine and priorities, carer support,\nemotional ability to engage, and prior illness experience. Further,\nTobiana et al \u2019s review (2020)10identi \ufb01ed health professionals \u2019\nactions that encourage patients \u2019self-management including helping\npatients with goal-setting, providing support in monitoring symp-\ntoms, and preparing them well for administering medications. Sup-port in monitoring symptoms can be enhanced through providing\npatients/carers with traf \ufb01c light tools\n20,24that can help patients and\ncarers recognize and report potentially life-threatening treatment-\nrelated symptoms. Traf \ufb01c light tools can clarify symptom severity\nand frequency and legitimize symptoms to report.20,24Further,\npatient and carer group consultations can also encourage self-man-\nagement through facilitating mutual support, patient recall, and col-\nlective (patient/carer) engagement in symptom management.22\nModerating Factors\nThe PCC model also includes factors that moderate relationships\nbetween patient-centered communication and outcomes, such as age\nand extent of disease. Additional moderators have been identi \ufb01ed by\nOakley et al (2017)3including carer-engagement, bereavement, and\nfatalistic beliefs.\nCarer Engagement\nA cancer diagnosis not only affects people with cancer, it is also\ndevastating for family and friends. All are thrown into adopting new\nroles and responsibilities. For carers, these can range from providing\nemotional support to practical and \ufb01nancial help and/or physical\ncare. Each phase from diagnosis through treatment to living with and\nbeyond cancer brings its own challenge for carers; carers are impor-\ntant for helping patients \u2019engagement in self-care to manage illness\nand associated treatment and to seek help in a timely fashion shouldpatients become unwell. However, research suggests that a third of\npeople with cancer are not asked by clinicians about their support\nnetwork.\n50Without asking, health professionals will be unaware of\nsupport structures available to, and needed by, patients as they prog-\nress through treatment.\nStudies of information giving by health professionals to people\nwith cancer,51-53and to those undergoing chemotherapy\nspeci \ufb01cally,54,55have determined that information delivery is pre-\ndominantly patient centric. Carers report feeling excluded from dia-\nlogue and lacking con \ufb01dence in supporting patients to recognize and\nreport symptoms of disease progression or treatment toxicity orC. Oakley and E.

    "text": "knowing who to call in case of emergency.17,51,55,56\u2018Feeling unpre-\npared to care51,52,57,58and not knowing how to support patients3are\ncommon carer concerns.\nCancer nurses can address this by encouraging carers to attend\nappointments and identify ways of supporting patients. In some\ncases, it can help if patients share information with carers if the latter\ncannot attend appointments and give permission to carers to seek\nhelp for them if needed. Oakley et al \u2019s32017 study found patients ill-\nprepared to attend the hospital at short notice during chemotherapy;\nthey suggested patients and carers are guided in preparing for rapid\nunplanned hospital attendance if needed. Consideration may be\nrequired for childcare and work responsibilities.\nOlder People\nCancer nurses must understand the needs of older people with\ncancer and their carers in order to intervene appropriately to enable\nself-management and maintain patient safety. Interventions for older\npeople need to be co-designed with them to ensure their success and\nincorporate media (eg, self-management care plans, \ufb01lms, nurse-\nstructured home programs) that are \ufb01tting for them.49Choice must\nbe based on need and ability, for example, older adults may/may not\nembrace technology.59-61\nFurther, older people may have speci \ufb01c age-related concerns\nregarding treatment and care that need to be established and under-\nstood. A recent study suggests that relaying the summary of a com-prehensive geriatric assessment to oncologists planning and\ndiscussing care with patients and their carers\n62may enhance patient\nand carer-centered communication about age-related issues. Skills\nare needed by healthcare professionals to communicate effectively\nwith older people \u2014to ensure that the quality of communication is\nnot compromised alongside patient safety. Korc-Grodzicki et al\n(2020)2developed a training module to enhance the quality of com-\nmunication with older people with cancer with cognitive dif \ufb01culties.\nPatients with a degree of cognitive de \ufb01cit (and compromised hear-\ning) can \ufb01nd complex self-management instructions dif \ufb01cult to\nassimilate and act upon.\nFatalism\nOakley et al (2017)3suggest that fatalism should be incorporated\nwithin the PCC model. Cancer fatalism is the pessimistic belief that\nthe presence of cancer means inevitable death.63-66Research has\nidenti \ufb01ed an association between fatalism and late presentation with\nlocally advanced breast cancer67and in low uptake of breast and cer-\nvical cancer screening in ethnic minorities generally and in Black\nwomen particularly.63,64Religiosity is likely to play a part through\ntheir placing faith in a higher entity;3,66relying upon this entity to\ndirect health choices,64and ultimately a belief in some that if cancer\nis God \u2019s will, then it is not for them to intervene.3,68These beliefs\nmay manifest in people with high fatalism not engaging with cancer\ninformation64or being less likely to engage actively with cancer\nnurses and other health professionals in decisions regarding their\ncare.67\nHaving Advanced Breast Cancer and Being Bereaved\nAdvanced breast cancer alone or alongside bereavement could\nmoderate patient-centered communication. Patients with advanced\ndisease can express passivity during clinicians \u2019consultations on hear-\ning bad disease-related news.3,29,33,37An international study about\npreferences for control in decision-making among 1490 people with\nadvanced cancer (including advanced breast cancer) showed high\nsatisfaction with information sharing and decision-making.69Most\npreferred shared or active decision-making, with 23% preferring pas-\nsive decision control, signi \ufb01cant predictors of which included highereducation, higher performance status, and country of birth (eg, Brazil,\nSingapore, South Africa, Jordan).69The caveat is that desire for\ninvolvement and satisfaction are likely to vary according to country,\nperceived status of physicians, and actual level of hierarchy in physi-\ncian/C0patient relationship.\nResearch has shown a clear association between grief following\nbereavement and delayed patient presentation with breast cancer,\nincluding malignant breast cancer wounds.70Avoidance can be\nheightened when grief is complicated by beliefs that physicians have\nbeen unable to help family members who died from breast cancer.70\nAvoiding help-seeking for concerning symptoms during chemother-apy has also been reported in people with advanced disease and/or\nwho have been bereaved.\n3This may be because these people are par-\nticularly fearful of neutropenic sepsis and adopt avoidance and nor-\nmalizing behaviors to cope. Oakley et al (2017)3propose that\ntherapeutic relationships with clinicians are highly valued by these\npatients and that they are more likely to contact clinicians they feel\nconnected with if sepsis develops. Importantly, this may cause a\ndelay in treating neutropenic sepsis if the chosen clinician is not\nimmediately available.\nConclusion\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there are common, complex, and often\nintersecting reasons why patients with cancer may not engage well\nwith, assimilate, or act on information that nurses provide. Nurses\nneed to develop well-honed skills to address these issues, thereby\nensuring patients have a positive experience of care and that clinical\noutcomes are maximized. It is well known that health professionals \u2019\nown behaviors and approaches are critical to enabling patient\nengagement and the adoption of important self-management\nactions.\nThe PCC model provides an excellent guide to the domains that\nare important for effective patient education and engagement. The\nrelational and emotional aspects of imparting information, the timing\nand pacing of it, and the focus on patients \u2019/carers \u2019needs and capacity\nfor receiving it are important, as are ways to reduce uncertainty and\nprovide information at a time and pace and using approaches that\nsuit individuals. It is noteworthy that interventions to enhance\npatient/carers \u2019adoption of desired self-management strategies are\nbeing developed, largely based on behavior change theory, but evi-\ndence regarding effectiveness is lacking. More research is needed to\nhelp guide health professionals generally, and cancer nurses speci \ufb01-\ncally, in this aspect of caregiving. Well-honed skills are needed, and\nthis does have implications for education. We need to be clear across\ncurricula that nurses and other healthcare professionals have suf \ufb01-\ncient preparation and training to ensure that individual needs forinformation and support \u2014a patient-centered approach to communi-\ncation \u2014become the norm. This could radically enhance patients \u2019and\ncarers \u2019experiences and outcomes of care through their being more\nengaged in, and responsible for, it.\nDeclaration of Competing Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no known competing \ufb01nancial\ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to in \ufb02u-\nence the work reported in this paper.\nReferences\n1.

To manage the fatigue, make sure you're getting enough rest, staying hydrated, and maintaining a balanced diet. You can also try some light physical activity like walking to help improve your energy levels.\n\nFor the rash on your hands and feet, try applying a fragrance-free moisturizer frequently, avoid exposure to hot water, and protect your hands and feet by wearing gloves and comfortable shoes. If your symptoms are severe or worsen, please contact our office, as we might need to adjust your chemotherapy regimen or dosage.\n\nThere is no immediate need for worry, but make sure to report your symptoms and any changes during our next appointment or if they become more severe.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name, Oncologist]",

Additionally, cisplatin, one of the chemotherapy drugs you are receiving, can sometimes cause liver toxicity, which could contribute to these symptoms.\n\nI recommend that you contact your oncologist as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms. They may want to perform blood tests to check your liver function and assess whether any adjustments to your treatment plan are necessary."

It is not uncommon for patients undergoing chemotherapy, such as the adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide treatment you are currently receiving, to experience hair loss as a side effect. This occurs because chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells, which includes both cancer cells and hair follicles.\n\nHere are some recommendations to help minimize hair loss and manage its impact:\n\n1. Be gentle with your hair: Use a soft-bristle brush, avoid tight hairstyles, and minimize the use of heat-styling tools.\n\n2. Consider cutting your hair short: This can make hair loss less noticeable and easier to manage.\n\n3. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner: Look for products specifically designed for thinning hair or those labeled as \"gentle\" or \"moisturizing.\"\n\n4. Protect your scalp: Wear a hat or sunscreen when outdoors to protect your scalp from sunburn and other environmental factors.\n\n5. Explore hair coverings: You may want to consider wearing a wig, scarf, or hat to help cope with hair loss. Some insurance plans may cover the cost of a wig, so it's worth checking with your provider.\n\n6.

What can I do to minimize hair loss?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the provided information is sufficient to answer the patient's questions.\n\nDear [Patient's Name],\n\nI understand your concern about hair loss. It is not uncommon for patients undergoing chemotherapy, such as the adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide treatment you are currently receiving, to experience hair loss as a side effect. This occurs because chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells, which includes both cancer cells and hair follicles.\n\nHere are some recommendations to help minimize hair loss and manage its impact:\n\n1. Be gentle with your hair: Use a soft-bristle brush, avoid tight hairstyles, and minimize the use of heat-styling tools.\n\n2. Consider cutting your hair short: This can make hair loss less noticeable and easier to manage.\n\n3. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner: Look for products specifically designed for thinning hair or those labeled as \"gentle\" or \"moisturizing.\"\n\n4. Protect your scalp: Wear a hat or sunscreen when outdoors to protect your scalp from sunburn and other environmental factors.\n\n5. Explore hair coverings: You may want to consider wearing a wig, scarf, or hat to help cope with hair loss. Some insurance plans may cover the cost of a wig, so it's worth checking with your provider.\n\n6. Be patient: Hair loss due to chemotherapy is typically temporary, and your hair should begin to grow back within a few months after completing treatment.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen to help manage the pain. However, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new medications, as they can advise you on the appropriate dosage and potential interactions with your current medications.\n\n3. Applying a cold or warm compress to the affected area may also provide some relief. You can try alternating between cold and warm compresses to see which one works best for you.\n\n4. Gentle stretching and range-of-motion exercises may help alleviate some of the pain and stiffness. However, it is important to consult with your healthcare provider or a physical therapist before starting any new exercise regimen, especially if the pain is severe or worsening.\n\nRemember to contact your oncologist to discuss your symptoms and receive further evaluation and guidance on managing your pain."

It is important to monitor your pain and report any changes or worsening to your oncology team.\n\n3. In the meantime, you can try over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help manage your lower back pain. Be sure to follow the recommended dosages and consult with your oncologist before starting any new medications.\n\n4. It is also important to maintain good posture and engage in gentle exercises, such as walking or stretching, to help alleviate lower back pain.

Is this a side effect of my treatment, or should I be concerned about something else?",
    "response": "Based on the provided information, it is possible that the persistent itching and yellowing of your skin could be related to your cholangiocarcinoma or a side effect of your treatment. However, it is important to consider other potential causes as well.\n\nThe yellowing of your skin, also known as jaundice, can be a sign of liver dysfunction, which could be related to your stage IV cholangiocarcinoma. Itching can also be associated with liver problems. Additionally, cisplatin, one of the chemotherapy drugs you are receiving, can sometimes cause liver toxicity, which could contribute to these symptoms.\n\nI recommend that you contact your oncologist as soon as possible to discuss these symptoms. They may want to perform blood tests to check your liver function and assess whether any adjustments to your treatment plan are necessary."

It is not uncommon for patients to experience urinary symptoms such as frequent urination and discomfort during urination after a radical prostatectomy. However, since it has been a year since your surgery, it is important to evaluate the cause of these symptoms.\n\n2. Your medical history includes benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), which can also cause urinary symptoms. Your current medication, tamsulosin, is used to manage BPH symptoms. It is possible that your BPH symptoms are not well-controlled, or there could be another cause for your symptoms.\n\n3. Given your symptoms and medical history, it would be a good idea to schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss your symptoms and determine the appropriate course of action. They may want to perform a physical examination, review your medications, and possibly order some tests to rule out any infection or other causes of your symptoms.\n\n4. In the meantime, continue taking your medications as prescribed and monitor your symptoms. If you notice any significant changes or worsening of your symptoms, contact your healthcare provider immediately."

What can I do to minimize hair loss?\n\nAnswer: Yes, the provided information is sufficient to answer the patient's questions.\n\nDear [Patient's Name],\n\nI understand your concern about hair loss. It is not uncommon for patients undergoing chemotherapy, such as the adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide treatment you are currently receiving, to experience hair loss as a side effect. This occurs because chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells, which includes both cancer cells and hair follicles.\n\nHere are some recommendations to help minimize hair loss and manage its impact:\n\n1. Be gentle with your hair: Use a soft-bristle brush, avoid tight hairstyles, and minimize the use of heat-styling tools.\n\n2. Consider cutting your hair short: This can make hair loss less noticeable and easier to manage.\n\n3. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner: Look for products specifically designed for thinning hair or those labeled as \"gentle\" or \"moisturizing.\"\n\n4. Protect your scalp: Wear a hat or sunscreen when outdoors to protect your scalp from sunburn and other environmental factors.\n\n5. Explore hair coverings: You may want to consider wearing a wig, scarf, or hat to help cope with hair loss. Some insurance plans may cover the cost of a wig, so it's worth checking with your provider.\n\n6. Be patient: Hair loss due to chemotherapy is typically temporary, and your hair should begin to grow back within a few months after completing treatment.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.

However, it is essential to have the scar evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the cause of the bleeding and to rule out any possible recurrence of melanoma. I recommend contacting your primary care physician or oncologist to schedule an appointment for an examination of the scar.\n\n3. In the meantime, keep the area clean and dry, and avoid picking at or scratching the scar. You can apply an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment and cover it with a sterile bandage to help prevent infection.\n\n4. Continue to monitor the scar for any changes in appearance, size, or color, and report any concerns to your healthcare provider.\n\nRemember, it is always best to consult with your healthcare team for personalized advice and recommendations based on your specific medical history and situation."

It is not uncommon for patients undergoing chemotherapy, such as the adjuvant doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide treatment you are currently receiving, to experience hair loss as a side effect. This occurs because chemotherapy targets rapidly dividing cells, which includes both cancer cells and hair follicles.\n\nHere are some recommendations to help minimize hair loss and manage its impact:\n\n1. Be gentle with your hair: Use a soft-bristle brush, avoid tight hairstyles, and minimize the use of heat-styling tools.\n\n2. Consider cutting your hair short: This can make hair loss less noticeable and easier to manage.\n\n3. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner: Look for products specifically designed for thinning hair or those labeled as \"gentle\" or \"moisturizing.\"\n\n4. Protect your scalp: Wear a hat or sunscreen when outdoors to protect your scalp from sunburn and other environmental factors.\n\n5. Explore hair coverings: You may want to consider wearing a wig, scarf, or hat to help cope with hair loss. Some insurance plans may cover the cost of a wig, so it's worth checking with your provider.\n\n6.

Stay hydrated: Make sure to drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broth, or electrolyte replacement drinks (e.g., Gatorade or Pedialyte). Aim for at least 8-10 cups of fluid per day.\n\n2. Modify your diet: Try eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoid high-fiber, greasy, or spicy foods. Stick to a bland diet consisting of foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (also known as the BRAT diet).\n\n3. Over-the-counter medications: Since you mentioned that over-the-counter medications have not been helpful, I would recommend stopping them for now.\n\n4. Contact your healthcare team: It's important to inform your oncology team about your severe diarrhea, as they may need to adjust your chemotherapy regimen or prescribe a prescription-strength anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms.\n\nPlease reach out to your oncology team as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and receive further guidance. In the meantime, focus on staying hydrated and following the dietary recommendations provided.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"

These medications are available over-the-counter and can be taken as directed.\n\n3. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), such as omeprazole (Prilosec) or esomeprazole (Nexium), can also help reduce stomach acid production and provide relief from indigestion and heartburn. These medications are available over-the-counter and can be taken as directed.\n\n4. Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding spicy or fatty foods, eating smaller meals, not lying down immediately after eating, and elevating the head of the bed, can help alleviate indigestion and heartburn symptoms.\n\n5. It is important for the patient to discuss these symptoms with their healthcare team during their next visit or sooner if symptoms worsen or do not improve with over-the-counter medications and lifestyle modifications. The healthcare team may want to perform additional tests or imaging to rule out any complications or recurrence of cancer.\n\nPlease note that these recommendations are general and should be discussed with the patient's healthcare team before implementing any changes to their treatment plan."

Stay hydrated: Make sure to drink plenty of fluids, such as water, clear broth, or electrolyte replacement drinks (e.g., Gatorade or Pedialyte). Aim for at least 8-10 cups of fluid per day.\n\n2. Modify your diet: Try eating smaller, more frequent meals and avoid high-fiber, greasy, or spicy foods. Stick to a bland diet consisting of foods like bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast (also known as the BRAT diet).\n\n3. Over-the-counter medications: Since you mentioned that over-the-counter medications have not been helpful, I would recommend stopping them for now.\n\n4. Contact your healthcare team: It's important to inform your oncology team about your severe diarrhea, as they may need to adjust your chemotherapy regimen or prescribe a prescription-strength anti-diarrheal medication to help manage your symptoms.\n\nPlease reach out to your oncology team as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and receive further guidance. In the meantime, focus on staying hydrated and following the dietary recommendations provided.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"

Vaginal dilator use: Continue using the vaginal dilator as recommended during your last oncology visit. Regular use of the dilator can help prevent vaginal shortening and narrowing, which can contribute to discomfort during intercourse.\n\n4. Pelvic floor exercises: Practicing pelvic floor exercises, such as Kegel exercises, can help improve muscle tone and reduce discomfort during intercourse.\n\n5. Communication: Talk openly with your partner about your discomfort and explore different positions or activities that may be more comfortable for you.\n\n6. Follow-up with your healthcare provider: If the above recommendations do not provide relief, or if your symptoms worsen, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider to discuss other potential treatment options.\n\nPlease remember that these recommendations are general and it's important to consult with your healthcare provider before starting any new treatments or therapies."

In your case, it is possible that the neoadjuvant radiation therapy and surgery you underwent for your retroperitoneal leiomyosarcoma may have affected your menstrual cycle. However, it is important to discuss these changes with your healthcare team to rule out any other potential causes and to determine if any further evaluation or intervention is needed."
